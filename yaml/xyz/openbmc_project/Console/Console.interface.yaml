    - name: UnixSocketId
      type: string
      description: >
       Unix socket identifier for a console. This is used by a process like
       bmcweb to put consoles, most likely host serial consoles, out on
       WebSocket Secure (wss).

    - name: WebSocketPath
      type: string
      description: >
       The WebSocket Secure (wss) path for the console. This WebSocket Secure
       could then be used by a user interface to provide console acceess. An
       example of this would be webui-vue's use of xterm, a fully-featured
       terminal in the browser. If this path was /console0, the console would
       be available at wss://$bmc/console0.
