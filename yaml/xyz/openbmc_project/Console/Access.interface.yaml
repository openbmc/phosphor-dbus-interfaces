properties:
    - name: SocketName
      type: array[byte]
      description: >
          Unix socket identifier for a console. This is used by a process like
          bmcweb to put consoles, most likely host serial consoles, out on
          WebSocket Secure (wss). This attribute provides unix abstract socket
          name and it's first character is always null hence the attribute type
          is an array of bytes instead of string. The byte array does not
          include a null terminator.
      flags:
          - readonly
