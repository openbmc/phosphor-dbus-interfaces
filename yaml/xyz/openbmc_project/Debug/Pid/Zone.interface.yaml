          A mapping from sensor name to the canonical enum reason for that
          sensor's current fail-safe state within this zone. Sensors are added
          to this map when they are detected as failed, and removed
          automatically when they recover. An empty map indicates that all
          sensors are currently healthy.

          Canonical fail-safe reasons for sensors
      values:
          - name: MissingSensor
            description: Sensor D-Bus object missing.
          - name: Timeout
            description: Sensor timed out waiting for data.
          - name: BadReading
            description: Sensor returned non-finite reading.
          - name: MarginHot
            description: Thermal margin at or below zero.
          - name: ThresholdAsserted
            description: Critical (or warning, if enabled) threshold asserted.
          - name: Unavailable
            description: Sensor is unavailable.
          - name: NotFunctional
            description: Sensor is not functional.
          - name: Unknown
            description: Unknown or unspecified failure reason.
