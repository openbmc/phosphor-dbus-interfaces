    Implement this to add Resource dump management.

    The resource dumps are special types of dumps generated by host hypervisor.
    The dump is generated based on the resource selector. Hyperviosr needs a
    password to validate the request before creating the dump.

properties:
    - name: SourceDumpId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          The dump id provided by the source of the dump. There are dumps which
          get generated outside the BMC, like a resource dump which gets
          generated and stored in the host memory. All dumps will have a unique
          id but when communicating to the source of the dump the SourceDumpId
          will be used.
    - name: VSPString
      type: string
      description: >
          The resource selector for generating the dump.
    - name: Password
      type: string
      description: >
          The password required by host to validate the request.
    - name: Token
      type: uint32
      description: >
          A token exchanged with an external firmware subsystem when creating a
          dump outside of the BMC. This token can be used to identify the dump
          entry once the collection is completed.
