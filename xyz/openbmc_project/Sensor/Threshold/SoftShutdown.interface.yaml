description: >
    Implement to provide soft shutdown class sensor thresholds.  Objects
    implementing Sensor.Threshold.Shutdown must be instantiated in the correct
    hierarchy within the sensors namespace.  The following sensor hierarchies
    are recognized:
      temperature
      fan_tach
      voltage
      altitude
      current
      power
      energy


    Additionally, any object implementing Sensor.Threshold.SoftShutdown must
    also implement Sensor.Value.

properties:
    - name: SoftShutdownHigh
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The upper bound of the soft shutdown threshold.  A value of 'NaN' is
          used to indicate there is no threshold of this type.
    - name: SoftShutdownLow
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The lower bound of the soft shutdown threshold.  A value of 'NaN' is
          used to indicate there is no threshold of this type.
    - name: SoftShutdownAlarmHigh
      type: boolean
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bound.
          False if the sensor value has not exceeded the defined bound.

          SoftShutdownAlarmHigh may be set to False to clear an alarm condition.
          The behavior of setting SoftShutdownAlarmHigh to True is undefined.
    - name: SoftShutdownAlarmLow
      type: boolean
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bound.
          False if the sensor value has not exceeded the defined bound.

          SoftShutdownAlarmLow may be set to False to clear an alarm condition.
          The behavior of setting SoftShutdownAlarmLow to True is undefined.
    - name: HysteresisHigh
      type: double
      default: 0
      description: >
          The hysteresis on SoftShutdownHigh.  This means that before
          SoftShutdownAlarmHigh will get reset, the sensor value would have to
          decrease to at least SoftShutdownHigh - HysteresisHigh.
    - name: HysteresisLow
      type: double
      default: 0
      description: >
          The hysteresis on SoftShutdownLow.  This means that before
          SoftShutdownAlarmLow will get reset, the sensor value would have to
          increase to at least SoftShutdownLow + HysteresisLow.
