      "message": "1. We should move this nearby the other memory metrics.\n\n2. Right now the only primary path is \"BMC\" (see line 122), but I think you said these are for \"GPUs\".  We also need some sort of path segment to identify the device(s) these are for.\n\n3. I don\u0027t know what \"capacity utilization\" means.  How is that different from `(available/total)`?  Is there any reason why we\u0027re wanting to represent this as a specific piece of math (to create a percentage) rather than give the real underlying numbers, which are already identified here?",
