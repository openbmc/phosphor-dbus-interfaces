description: >
    Simple definition of a Software or Firmware version. Note that this
    interface may be implemented by D-Bus objects that do not necessarily
    contain a software level. For example an OpenBMC log may implement this
    interface to store the software level of the BMC or Host for debug purposes.
    If looking for real software versions associated with a device then ensure
    this interface is under the /xyz/openbmc_project/software object path.
