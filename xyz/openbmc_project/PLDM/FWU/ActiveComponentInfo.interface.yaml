  This interface has the component entries for all of the updateable
  active components that reside on the FD.

properties:

    - name: ComponentClassification
      type: uint16
      description: >
        Vendor specific component classification information.
        Special values: 0x0000, 0xFFFF are reserved.

    - name: ComponentIdentifier
      type: uint16
      description: >
        FD vendor selected unique value to distinguish between
        component images.

    - name: ComponentClassificationIndex
      type: byte
      description: >
        Used to distinguish identical components that have the same
        classification and identifier that can use the same component
        image but the images are stored in different locations in the FD.

    - name: ActiveComponentComparisonStamp
      type: uint32
      description: >
        Optional Firmware component comparison stamp that is currently
        active. If the firmware component does not provide a component
        comparison stamp, this value should be set to 0x00000000.

    - name: ActiveComponentReleaseDate
      type: string
      description: >
        Containing the date corresponding to the component version
        level being reported – Format YYYYMMDD.
        If the firmware component does not provide a date, this string
        shall be empty.

    - name: ComponentAutoApply
      type: boolean
      description: >
        Firmware Device performs an ‘auto-apply’ during transfer
        phase and apply step will be completed immediately if this
        property is true.
        Firmware Device will execute an operation during the APPLY
        state that will include migrating the new component image to its
        final non-volatile storage destination if this property is
        false.

    - name: ActiveComponentVersionString
      type: string
      description: >
        String describing the active component version.
