    Implement to provide Rotor attributes.
    This interface should be at the same object path as a Fan for single-rotor
    fans or as a set of sub-path for multi-rotor fan design.

properties:
    - name: NominalVoltage
      type: int64
      description: >
        The nominal voltage of the fan in mV.

    - name: NominalCurrent
      type: int64
      description: >
        The nominal maximum current of the fan in mA.

    - name: NominalRPM
      type: int64
      description: >
        The nominal speed of the fan in RPMs.
