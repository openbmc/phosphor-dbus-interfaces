    Implement to schedule Epoch time to power on/off the Host.
properties:
    - name: ScheduledTime
      type: uint64
      default: 0
      description: >
          ScheduledTime is a date time when the host will be powered on/off. The
          time is the Epoch time, number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970 00::00::00
          UTC.

          When ScheduledTime is 0, it means the functionality is disabled. When
          ScheduledTime is smaller than current time, error InvalidTime will be
          thrown. When the controller detects the ScheduledTime has passed, it
          will execute the ScheduledTransition and reset the value to 0. Once
          the transition starts, there won't be any retries. When the real time
          changes, the controller shall check if the time is still in the
          future. If so, it will stop the existing timer and restart it with new
          wait time. Otherwise, stop the existing timer and execute the
          ScheduledTransition. When ScheduledTime is reached, but the host is
          not ready to power on/off, e.g. when BMC is rebooting, BMC shall set
          the host ScheduledTransition after it is ready.
