      "message": "I can’t tell if these interfaces are intended to be free-standing items, which are inserted into a path hierarchy, or they really should be decorators.  This “embedded” one especially doesn’t seem like a free-standing item.\n\nThe three interfaces you’ve defined here are all connector types?  Should we create a connector subdirectory?\n\nI dislike the name of this interface without additional context.  I understand if you’re trying to match Redfish, but as a casual investigator if I were to come across a file ‘Item.Embedded’ I’d really have no idea what it means.  I think we should strive to provide better context on this one.",
