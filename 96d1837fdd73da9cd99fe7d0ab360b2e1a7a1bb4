      "message": "But I think that needs to be decided by the admin, Its a patchable property in redfish and the rationale comes from how redfish models *policy intent*, not *operational usability*.\n\nAlthough setting `SPDMAllowedVersions \u003d NONE` makes SPDM unusable, redfish intentionally allows this because the property expresses administrative security policy, not protocol capability. A patchable policy allows an operator or external policy authority to explicitly state “SPDM must not be used”, even if the feature is present and enabled in the implementation.\n\nThis supports valid scenarios such as security lockdowns, vulnerability mitigation, regulatory compliance, or staged provisioning, where SPDM must be temporarily or intentionally disabled without removing the feature itself. \n\nI think that redfish does not guarantee that a policy configuration results in a usable protocol; it guarantees that *policy intent* can be expressed and enforced deterministically. So including `NONE` as a valid, patchable value is intentional and consistent with other Redfish security policies (for example, TLS cipher policies in the secure policy schema), even if it results in SPDM being effectively disabled.",
