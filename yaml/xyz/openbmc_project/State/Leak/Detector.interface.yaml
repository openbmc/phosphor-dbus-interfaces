    Implement to provide attributes for leak detector.

properties:
    - name: PrettyName
      type: string
      description: >
          The human readable name of the leak detector.
      flags:
          - readonly
    - name: State
      type: boolean
      description: >
          The state of the detector. The value of true means the leak is
          detected and false means there is no leak.
      flags:
          - readonly
    - name: Type
      type: enum[self.DetectorType]
      description: >
          The type of leak detector.

enumerations:
    - name: DetectorType
      description: >
          This indicates the type of leak detector as in Redfish LeakDetector
          schema https://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/LeakDetector.v1_2_0.json.
      values:
          - name: LeakSensingCable
            description: >
                A leak sensing cable.
          - name: Unknown
            description: >
                An unknown detector type
    - name: DetectorState
      description: >
          This indicates the state of the leak detector
      values:
          - name: Normal
            description: >
                The state is normal as no leaks have been detected by the leak
                detector.
          - name: Abnormal
            description: >
                A leak has been detected by the leak detector, indicating an
                abnormal leak state.
          - name: Unknown
            description: >
                The state cannot be determined as the detector may be faulty.

associations:
    - name: monitoring
      description: >
          Leak detectors can optionally implement the 'monitoring' association
          with the inventory item related to it.

          with the detector group related to it.
