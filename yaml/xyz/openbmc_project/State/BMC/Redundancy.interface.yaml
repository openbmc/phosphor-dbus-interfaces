    This interface holds redundant BMC related information.  There would be
    instance of this interface on each BMC.

          If redundancy is currently enabled.  In general, this means that the
          BMCs are configured as active and passive and that the passive is able
          to be failed over to.

enumerations:

          Defines the redundancy role of the BMC.
      values:
          - name: Undetermined
            description: >
                The role has not been determined.
          - name: Active
            description: >
                The role is for the active BMC.  This is the fully functioning
                BMC and the main point of contact for external users.
          - name: Passive
            description: >
                The role is for the passive BMC, which is the opposite of the
                active BMC.  It may not have all services running, and would
                require a failover to become active.
