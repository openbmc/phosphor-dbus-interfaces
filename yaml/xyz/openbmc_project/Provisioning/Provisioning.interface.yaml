    Interface to represent the provisioning status of the BMC. Provides a
    property to indicate whether the BMC is provisioned, and methods to initiate
    provisioning and check the peer BMC connection.
properties:
    - name: Provisioned
      type: boolean
      flags:
          - readonly
      default: false
      description: >
          True means the BMC is in a provisioned state.
    - name: PeerConnected
      type: boolean
      flags:
          - readonly
      default: false
      description: >
          True if a peer BMC is present and detected on the network. False if no
          peer BMC is present or not connected.
methods:
    - name: ProvisionPeer
      description: >
          Starts the provisioning process on the peerBmc .

    - name: InitiatePeerConnectionTest
      description: >
          Initiates a mutual TLS (mTLS) handshake with the peer BMC to verify
          connectivity. The outcome of the attempt (success or failure) is
          reflected in the PeerConnected property.
signals:
    - name: PeerProvisioned
      description: >
          Emitted when the ProvisionPeer method completes. The signal carries a
          boolean indicating whether provisioning on the peer succeeded or
          failed.
      args:
          - type: boolean
