      "message": "The current design is that there can be multiple Activation interfaces from a single Version and those Activation interfaces are hosted at sub-paths.  The primary/secondary flash bank is one such example that is clearly identified here.  The Activation path might be something like `/xyz/openbmc_project/software/12345/bmc-primary` (for well-defined paths we should probably enumerate in this document what the expectations are).\n\nThis is why I don\u0027t understand why we need a new UpdateTarget interface.  There are already separate Activations that tell you which device you are updating.  The advantage of separate Activations is that it also handles other device types (than just dual flash banks of the BMC).  We are already implementing support for multi-host BIOS update (devices might be host-1, host-2, host-3).  You could also handle VRs, CPLDs, Xeon ME, etc. like this.  IMO separate Activation interfaces is far more flexible because it handles _all_ these cases and not just a dual flash BMC.\n\nSince the separate Activation interfaces _can_ handle a dual-flash BMC, like you are proposing, I don\u0027t see a reason to also have a different way to handle it (ie. your UpdateTarget proposal).  This makes additional work for external interfaces, like bmcweb/Redfish, to special case the BMC.",

I believe they\u0027re going to do refactoring of phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt as well.\n\nTheir design, which I\u0027m working through with them, is at:\n   https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/docs/+/37950\n\n\u003e With the sub-path concept, the item-updater may need to create two activation objects for this:\n\u003e  /xyz/openbmc_project/software/\u003cid-to-be-updated\u003e/bmc_primary\n\u003e  /xyz/openbmc_project/software/\u003cid-to-be-updated\u003e/bmc_secondary\n\u003e \n\u003e Is the above expected?\n\nYes, this is exactly what it expected.

I think you\u0027re asking about the concept of garbage collection.\n\nThe ImageManager currently (as implemented today) keeps the images which could be activated and is responsible for garbage collecting them.  A reboot would usually cause them to be remove automatically since we keep them in tmpfs.  Otherwise there are two options:\n\n1. The ImageManager is already expected to expose a Object.Delete interface to allow proactive garbage collection (removal of the unapplied image).\n\n2. The ImageManager is expected to monitor for all targets to be Activated or Staged and then automatically garbage collect.\n\nBoth of these options are documented here:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Software/README.md#image-clean-up",

I just posted that question in the multi-host review.\n\nIt is not based on MANIFEST fields but dbus paths.\n\n\u003e I think for this dual bmc case we can go ahead and implement the WriteProtected property: \n\nI agree with this.\n\n\u003e The item updater would create the new subpath interfaces for each bmc (the Activation interfaces can stay under \u003cid\u003e for simplicity and updated as part of the multi host work), \n\nSounds good.  You wrote \"as part of the multi-host work\" but keep in mind that the majority of the multi-host work being proposed for Yv2 (as an implementation) needs to go through a separate micro-controller.  There is a design being worked for a separate daemon to manage that micro-controller since it handles much more than just code-update.  So the work would not naturally touch this code in phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt.",
