The secret key file itself is an implementation detail, and really all we should be returning is \"file has been created successfully\", right?\n\nIf we DO need to return it, in terms of size, shouldn\u0027t we just be returning this as a string/byte array (depending on if it\u0027s binary or not)?  I didn\u0027t think these secret keys were all that big.",
