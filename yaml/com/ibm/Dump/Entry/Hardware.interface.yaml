    Implement this to add Hardware dump management.

    Hardware dump is a collection hardware state information, including various
    registers, and it is used for debugging system checkstop. checkstop is the
    descriptive term for entire system termination by the hardware due to a
    detected error.

properties:
    - name: ErrorLogId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          The id of the log associated with the action which triggered the dump.
          This ID is a reference to an error log entry in the logging system.
          The value should be a 32-bit unsigned integer.

    - name: FailingUnitId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          A unique id of the failing hardware unit which is causing the dump.
          This ID could be used to identify the specific piece of hardware
          within the system. The value should be a 32-bit unsigned integer.
