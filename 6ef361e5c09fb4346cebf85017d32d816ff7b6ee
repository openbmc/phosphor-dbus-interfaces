      "message": "When I look at the implementation, I see that only GPU is currently used.  This seems like a perfect use of associations on first read.\n\nWhy should we take on the internal baggage of this gigantic enum just because maybe someone would want to use a random enum in the future?  It seems to me like association to the GPU inventory for the sensor fits our implementation model way better and the PhysicalContext could be derived from the association.  We already have sensor associations to inventory for other reasons, so if someone wanted to extend the implementation of Redfish-PhysicalContext they could already do that today.",

      "message": "I could be misremembering, but on a different patch a while back there was a comment on adding all Redfish enum values when we had added just one which was relevant to the implementation. Of course there were only 4-5 enum values in Redfish in that scenario.\n\nI did consider associations but didn\u0027t go that route for a couple reasons:\n1. Today the association is between a sensor and a chassis/board item, not something like a CPU or accelerator. It is also not mandatory that this chassis/board object is the one that also implements CPU or accelerator.\n\n2. I didn\u0027t think inventing a new association for this is a better option overall for physical context as not all of those context items map to inventory items.\n\n\nI see a couple of options now:\n1. Modify this to reduce the enum to map to only what the implementation uses, which is GPU.\n\n2. Pursue an association based solution. It could be workable for inventory items like GPU but not for \"area\" items like front/back.\n\nI would prefer 1, but I will think about 2 if you are unwilling to accept a D-Bus interface for this.",

      "message": "This enum is ridiculously long, which I understand the same one from Redfish is also this long.\n\nAre we certain that any sensor could represent any of these?  Are there any restrictions we should put in place?  Are there any of these we have no intention of using right now?\n\n1. If there are restrictions where you wouldn\u0027t use some values for a specific sensor type, we should probably break it out into enums that can be obviously related to the use case.\n\n2. I am 100% certain we do not have intended uses for all of these right now.  What we\u0027ve almost always said was that even if Redfish defines a large enum space, we should only define the ones that are expected to be used (in the near term) and if people want to add new ones later on they can add them as they show need/use.",
