    Interface to control the virtual System Attention Indicator(SAI).
    Currently, two such virtual indicators are defined, namely,
    Partition and Platform.

    What is a System Attention Indicator(SAI): When an error happens in the
    system, usually, it is isolated to a part to be replaced and the LED
    for that faulty part would be turned on.

    However, in some cases, it may not be possible to isolate the issue to a
    particular part. In those cases, the error needs to be anyway reported
    telling that there is something wrong in the system, but the part can not
    be isolated to. An analysis of event logs would be needed to isolate the
    faulty part to be serviced.

    As a visual indication, a dedicated LED, System Attention Indicator
    may be designed to be turned [On] for such usecases.

    Such errors can be detected either by Platform management functionality,
    BMC; or can be detected by the upper layer partitions. When the physical
    System Attention Indicator is turned [on], it would be useful to say why
    it is turned on. As in, is it turned on due to an error seen by BMC or
    is it due to an error seen by the partition or both.

    If BMC encounters an error that falls under SAI category, then BMC will
    set a virtual SAI, which is nothing but a software setting indicating so
    and is called "Platform Service Attention Indicator", abbreviated,
    PlatformSAI.

    Similarly, if a partition encounters an error, then a virtual SAI will
    be set and is called "Partition Service Attention Indicator", abbreviated,
    PartitionSAI.

    As one possible implementation, The Physical SAI LED will be turned [On]
    if either of these virtual SAIs are [On]. Similarly, Physical SAI LED
    will be turned [Off] when both these virtual SAI indicators are [Off].
