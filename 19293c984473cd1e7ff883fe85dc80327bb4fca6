Currently obmc-ikvm (AFAIK) only deals in JPEGs, but that\u0027s largely just a side-effect of some implementation details -- PNG, for example, is in most cases a much more natural format for screenshots (and we might want to support it at some point).\n\nSome possibilities:\n - Add an enum argument to request a specific format (though the only implementation for the foreseeable future will likely just return an error for anything but JPEG)\n - Leave it as is without an argument, but change the name to reflect a specific format, e.g. CaptureJPEG\n - No change at all, leaving it implicit/undefined (up to the caller to inspect the file header, I guess)\n\nThoughts?  I think the first would be the most \"thorough\" and extensible, if a bit more work; the second might be a reasonable compromise.",
