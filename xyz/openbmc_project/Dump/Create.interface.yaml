    Implement to capture various types of dumps from the
    host or BMC. This interface is for user to request a particular
    type of dump.

    Any OpenBMC implementation should provide one implementation
    of xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Create per dump type on
    /xyz/openbmc_project/dump/<dump type>. On multi-host or on multi-BMC
    systems the instance number can be added to the path to differentiate,
    for example /xyz/openbmc_project/dump/<dump type><instance-id>.


methods:
    - name: CreateDump
