    instance of this interface on each BMC.

          If redundancy is currently enabled.  In general, this means that the
          BMCs are configured as active and passive and that the passive is able
          to be failed over to.

      errors:

      description: >
          This is used to immediately and persistently disable redundancy.  The
          use case is there are test phases where redundancy is not wanted and
          this is how that is accomplished.

          If set back to true, redundancy will immediately be re-enabled,
          assuming nothing else is preventing it.

          This can only be changed on the active BMC and when power is off,
          otherwise it will throw the Unavailable error.

      flags:
          - readonly
      default: false
      description: >
          When redundancy is enabled, there may be periods when either failovers
          are not allowed, such as in the middle of a code update, or won't work
          because the passive BMC is temporarily offline, such as when the
          passive BMC reboots. A timer would be put on how long redundancy could
          still be considered enabled in this latter case in case the passive
          BMC never comes back.  Redundancy is left enabled initially so as to
          not trigger any intervention that could be necessary when redundancy
          is lost just due to a BMC reboot.  Any time the passive BMC goes
          offline a full file sync would be necessary when it comes back.

enumerations:

          Defines the redundancy role of the BMC.
      values:
          - name: Unknown
            description: >
                The role is unknown.
          - name: Active
            description: >
                The role is for the active BMC.  This is the fully functioning
                BMC and the main point of contact for external users.
          - name: Passive
            description: >
                The role is for the passive BMC, which is the opposite of the
                active BMC.  It may not have all services running, and would
                require a failover to become active.

signals:
    - name: Heartbeat
      description: >
          This signal is to be emitted periodically from the management daemon
          to let the sibling BMC interface daemon know it is alive.
