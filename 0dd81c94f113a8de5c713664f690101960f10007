      "message": "Got it.\n\nI guess I left this TODO in the design document:\n\n```\n\u003e TODO: Should a tracing event be a `Logging.Entry` with severity of\n\u003e `Informational` or should they be a new type, such as `Logging.Event` and\n\u003e managed separately. The `phosphor-logging` default `meson.options` have\n\u003e `error_cap\u003d200` and `error_info_cap\u003d10`. If we increase the total number of\n\u003e events allowed to 10K, the majority of them are likely going to be information\n\u003e / tracing events.\n```\n\nDo you have thoughts around this?  I was partially leaning towards using `Informational` severity as an \"Event\".  It seems like you prefer to have them in a separate `Event` interface, but I\u0027m not sure the rationale.",
