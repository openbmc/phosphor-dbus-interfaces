      "message": "I wonder if this would be more appropriate as a new interface under org.openbmc_project.Common.Mutable ? It doesn\u0027t seem like this is a concept that needs to be specific to sensors and it doesn\u0027t seem like all sensor implementations would be interested in having this.  Making it an optional common interface solves both of these concerns.",
