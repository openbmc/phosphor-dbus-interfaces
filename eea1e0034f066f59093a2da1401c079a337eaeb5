      "message": "In the current design of the dbus interfaces, they intentionally DON\u0027T mirror redfish (or any other protocol) on dbus.  This is to make it easier to port to new APIs in the future, for example, Redfish didn\u0027t exist when the dbus interfaces were first created, yet we were able to add them with relatively few interface-level changes (mostly additions).  This change would be a significant departure from that, which I don\u0027t think is great, considering that in terms of major protocols, we support PLDM, IPMI, and Redfish today, and duplicating the idea of a \"status\" between all three of them would be very wasteful.",

This commit also \"introduce new interfaces\", without deprecating or removing the old ones, so I\u0027m not really following why this patchset is better.  If this were consolidating and removing/deprecating the old status APIs and consolidating them (along with patchsets to update the relevant daemons), i think I could support it more, but as writte, it\u0027s just yet another interface, without clear rules on when to use the existing interfaces, and when to use this interface.",

I see having yet another interface that duplicates behavior as less maintainable than what exists today, given that we will have essentially forked all interfaces down two paths.
