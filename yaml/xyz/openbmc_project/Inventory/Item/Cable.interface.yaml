    xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Cable should be implemented on objects
    that represent a cable instance or a system cable instance.
properties:
    - name: Length
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The length of the cable in meters.  The default value of NaN
          represents a cable of unknown length.

      type: string
      default: ""
      description: >
          A free form, implementation defined string used to provide the type
          of a cable, such as optical or copper.  The cable type can be shown
          in user interfaces but this field should not be used for programmatic
          interrogation of a cable beyond ignoring the default value of the
          empty string.
