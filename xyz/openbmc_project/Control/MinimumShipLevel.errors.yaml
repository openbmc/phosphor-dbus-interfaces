- name: NotMet
  description: >
    An inventory item does not meet the minimum version requirements and needs
    to be updated. Some usage examples for this error include creating logging
    events and providing information on implementation reactions such as when
    the system is prevented from powering on if the MinimumShipLevel is not met.
