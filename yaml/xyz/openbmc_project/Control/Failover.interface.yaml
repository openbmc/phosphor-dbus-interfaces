    Implement to provide an interface to start a failover.  Depending on the
    implementation, this may reside on the 'from' or 'to' object (or both).  The
    'Options' method argument provides a mechanism to provide implementation
    specific options.

methods:
    - name: StartFailover
      description: >
          Starts a failover operation.
      parameters:
          - name: Options
            type: dict[string, variant[boolean]]
            description: >
                Additional options. The key is the string version of the Options
                enum, in the form of
                'xyz.openbmc_project.Control.Failover.Options.X'.
      errors:
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.Unavailable

properties:
    - name: FailoverInProgress
      type: boolean
      default: false
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          Indicates that a failover is in progress.

enumerations:
    - name: Options
      description: >
          Available options for starting the failover.
      values:
          - name: "Force"
            description: >
                A boolean option to force the failover when it would normally
                not be available.  The checks it bypasses are implementation
                dependent.
