    Describe an MCTP endpoint. It is an MCTP communication terminus. An MCTP
    endpoint is a terminus or origin of MCTP packets or messages. The combined
    functionality within a physical device that communicates using the MCTP
    transport protocol and handles MCTP control commands. This includes
    MCTP-capable management controllers and managed devices. MCTP bridges are
    not modelled on the D-Bus. This interface will be typically implemented by
    the MCTP control process daemon alias mcptd and aids in the discovery of
    MCTP enabled devices by higher layer protocols (like PLDM, SPDM) which are
    implemented in the userspace. The D-Bus object path that implements this
    interface will be typically named
    xyz/openbmc_project/mctp/<MCTP network ID>/endpointN where MCTP network ID
    corresponds to the MCTP network this endpoint is part of and N is a unique
    number and does not correspond to the actual endpoint ID. There will be a
    D-Bus object for every endpoint that is discovered by the mctpd. The object
    may also optionally implement xyz.openbmc_project.Common.UUID interface to
    address the requirement for devices with multiple endpoints and for
    hot-plug devices. The lifetime of the D-Bus object is the lifetime of the
    connected MCTP device. The higher layer protocols like PLDM will depend on
    this D-Bus interface to do discovery of MCTP endpoints that support PLDM
    using SupportedMessageTypes property and then initiate a PLDM discovery
    flow. Also mctpd discovers the removal of the MCTP devices, removes the
    D-Bus objects and allows upper layer protocols to take appropriate actions.

properties:

    - name: NetworkId
      type: uint16
      description: >
          A unique identifier to distinguish each independent MCTP network
          within a platform.

    - name: EID
      type: byte
      description: >
          The logical address used to route MCTP messages to a specific MCTP
          endpoint. A numeric handle (logical address) that uniquely identifies
          a particular MCTP endpoint within a system for MCTP communication and
          message routing purposes. Endpoint IDs are unique among MCTP
          endpoints that comprise an MCTP communication network within a
          system. MCTP EIDs are only unique within a particular MCTP network.
          That is, they can be duplicated or overlap from one MCTP network to
          the next. This is also referred to as "endpoint ID" and abbreviated
          as "EID".

    - name: SupportedMessageTypes
      type: array[byte]
      description: >
          List of MCTP message types supported by the MCTP endpoint. MCTP
          message type is an enumeration that identifies the type of the
          communication payload in an MCTP message. The well defined message
          types are MCTP Control(0x00), PLDM(0x01), NC-SI over MCTP(0x02),
          Ethernet over MCTP(0x03), NVM Express Management Messages over
          MCTP(0x04) and SPDM over MCTP(0x05). There are ranges for vendor
          defined message types. All the message types are specified in the
          DSP0239 specification. A device that supports a given message type
          may not support that message type equally across all buses that
          connect to the device.
