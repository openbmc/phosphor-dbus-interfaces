properties:
    - name: ScheduledTime
      type: uint64
      default: 0
      description: >
          ScheduledTime is a date time when the host will be
          powered on/off. The time is the Epoch time, number
          of seconds since 1 Jan 1970 00::00::00 UTC.

          When ScheduledTime is 0, it means the function
          Scheduled Host Transition is disabled.
          When ScheduledTime is smaller than current time,
          error InvalidTime will be thrown.
          When ScheduledTime is past, its value is reset to
          0 again.
