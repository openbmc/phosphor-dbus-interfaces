    Implement to provide max observed value of the Sensor reading (device
    reports the value based on pre defined sampling interval). Any object
    implementing Sensor.PeakValue must also implement Sensor.Value.

properties:
    - name: PeakValue
      type: double
      description: >
          The max observed value of the Sensor reported by the sensor.
      flags:
          - readonly
      default: -infinity
    - name: PeakValueTimestamp
      type: uint64
      description: >
          The time at which the max value of the Sensor reading is observed. The
          value unit is time elapsed since the Epoch (1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC),
          in microseconds.
