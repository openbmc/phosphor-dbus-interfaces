          It can be utilized to disable synchronization when the redundant BMC
          is in a faulty state.

          It does not interrupt ongoing sync operations. If the redundant BMC
          network is unstable, the ongoing sync operation will fail and attempt
          retries. However, it will not proceed if this property value is set to
          true.

          This property represents the current status of the full

          Sync events run in the background and trigger synchronization when
          expected events occur, such as file or directory modifications or
          periodic syncing. This property helps monitor the latest overall
          health of background sync events.

          - name: FullSyncFailed
            description: >
                The full synchronization process has failed due to an error or
