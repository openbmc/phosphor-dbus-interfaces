      "message": "I think we have some bad naming going on here. EthernetInterface is used for any interface on the system, not just physical `eth*` interface. Both EthernetInterface and VlanInterface have an `InterfaceName` and it\u0027s the same value for both interfaces currently. Maybe it would make sense to have `ParentInterface` being a property of the VlanInterface but that would likely be an ObjectPath return type.",

I would have expected something like:\n\n.../eth0 \u003c-- EthernetInterface\n.../eth0/vlan1 \u003c-- VLAN\n\nIn this way the \"ParentInterface\" is obvious.
