      "message": "I\u0027ve added some people who might care about this change or who have previously edited this interface.\n\nAre we proposing this change because?\n   1) It is redundant.\n   2) It conflicts with the same property being used on two interfaces.\n\nIf it is (1), I suspect that is not the case.  You usually have a manufacturer for the card, which would be the Asset, and a manufacturer for the PCIe chip, which would be here.\n\nIf it is (2), we may have some Redfish interface impacts and a few others but I suspect those are minor.  We likely have impacts to entity-manager and a few misc provider repositories (smbios-mdr, peci-pcie).",

      "message": "I cannot speak to the design decisions of Redfish.\n\nThe \"Manufacturer\" listed in Redfish for PCIeDevice does appear to be the Asset.Manufacturer in our design, which is the manufacturer of the PCIe Card.\n\nThere is also \"VendorId\" under PCIeFunction, which is what I suspect the \"Manufacturer\" here attempted to document.  I wasn\u0027t around when Jason wrote this interface originally, so I\u0027m only guessing.\n\nBased on Redfish (and reality) we would ideally have a collection of PCIeFunction from smbios and not just a single one.  This would likely be separate from the device and could be where the \"VendorId\" is placed.",
