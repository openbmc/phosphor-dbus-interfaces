description: >
    Describe an MCTP endpoint. It is an MCTP communication terminus. An MCTP
    endpoint is a terminus or origin of MCTP packets or messages. The combined
    functionality within a physical device that communicates using the MCTP
    transport protocol and handles MCTP control commands. This includes
    MCTP-capable management controllers and managed devices.

properties:
    - name: NetworkId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          A locally defined identifier to distinguish each independent MCTP
          network within a platform. The network IDs are used by the MCTP stack
          to index separate MCTP Networks. This along with EID is used by upper
          layer protocols to address the destination endpoint.

    - name: EID
      type: byte
      description: >
          The logical address used to route MCTP messages to a specific MCTP
          endpoint. A numeric handle (logical address) that uniquely identifies
          a particular MCTP endpoint within a system for MCTP communication and
          message routing purposes. Endpoint IDs are unique among MCTP endpoints
          that comprise an MCTP communication network within a system. MCTP EIDs
          are only unique within a particular MCTP network. That is, they can be
          duplicated or overlap from one MCTP network to the next. This is also
          referred to as "endpoint ID" and abbreviated as "EID".

    - name: SupportedMessageTypes
      type: array[byte]
      description: >
          List of MCTP message types supported by the MCTP endpoint. MCTP
          message type is an enumeration that identifies the type of the
          communication payload in an MCTP message. The well defined message
          types are MCTP Control(0x00), PLDM(0x01), NC-SI over MCTP(0x02),
          Ethernet over MCTP(0x03), NVM Express Management Messages over
          MCTP(0x04) and SPDM over MCTP(0x05). There are ranges for vendor
          defined message types. All the message types are specified in the
          DSP0239 specification. A device that supports a given message type may
          not support that message type equally across all buses that connect to
          the device.

    - name: VendorDefinedMessageTypes
      type: array[struct[byte,variant[uint16, uint32],uint16]]
      description: >
          List of vendor defined MCTP message types supported by the MCTP
          endpoint. Each entry is a structure containing: Vendor ID Format
          (byte), Vendor ID (variant), and Command Set (uint16). The Vendor ID
          Format and associated PCIe/IANA formats are defined by DSP0236. Vendor
          ID Format 0x00 indicates PCI Vendor ID (uint16) or 0x01 indicates IANA
          Enterprise Number (uint32). The Vendor ID variant holds either a
          uint16 (PCI format) or uint32 (IANA format) identifying the vendor or
          organization that defined the message capability set. The Command Set
          is a 16-bit numeric value or bit field specified by the vendor to
          identify a particular command set type or major version under the
          given vendor ID. Implementations should gracefully handle Vendor ID
          Format values they don't recognize, as DSP0236 may define additional
          formats in future revisions.
