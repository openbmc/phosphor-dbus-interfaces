    Implement to represent component integrity information acquired from
    a secure authentication or measurement of the protected components.

    A trusted component (e.g., iRoT or TPM) is typically involved to
    provide the info using a security protocol (e.g., SPDM).
properties:
    - name: Enabled
      type: boolean
      description: >
          An indication of whether security protocols are
          enabled for the component.

    - name: Type
      type: enum[self.SecurityTechnologyType]
      description: >
          The type of security technology for the
          component.

    - name: TypeVersion
      type: string
      description: >
          The version of the security technology.

    - name: LastUpdated
      type: string
      description: >
          The date and time when information for the
          component was last updated.

          The date of component update in ISO 8601 format as
          YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ.  Where 'T' is a literal character
          to separate date fields from time and 'Z' is a literal character
          to indicate UTC.

    - name: TargetComponentURI
      type: object_path
      description: >
          The link to the the component whose integrity
          that this resource reports.
      errors:
          # Indicate that the set object_path is not valid.
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InvalidArgument

    - name: ComponentsProtected
      type: array[object_path]
      description: >
          An array of objects that the target
          component protects.


enumerations:
    - name: SecurityTechnologyType
