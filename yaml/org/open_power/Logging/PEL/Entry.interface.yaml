properties:
    - name: Hidden
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: >
          Hidden Error - This flag allows events to be placed in a system, but
          remain hidden from the customer. This event log is visible to
          development personnel only, e.g. hardware recovered error, etc. No
          service action is required for this type of errors. In general, when
          this value is used, the Error Action Flags has the value of "Hidden
          Error". An event log with this value is used primarily for error
          thresholding design/code debug or as a record to indicate an error
          frequency or trend.
    - name: Subsystem
      type: string
      description: >
          A free form, implementation defined string which uniquely and
          permanently identifies a specific subsystem string. This field should
          not be used for programmatic interrogation of an object.
    - name: ManagementSystemAck
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: >
          Notifies the PEL handler that the management system acknowledged a
          PEL. The management system can be any system monitoring the hardware.
