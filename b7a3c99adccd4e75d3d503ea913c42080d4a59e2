      "message": "The systemd-networkd default is \"Vendor\" and not \"LinkLayer\".  Are we explicitly changing this with this proposal?  Will this affect anyone with machines already in production?  I suspect we\u0027re going to want this to match the DUIDType defaulted in systemd-networkd, since, until the code is implemented to manipulate the DUIDType that is the \"default\".\n\nWhen we get the the phosphor-networkd implementation we\u0027ll want to think about how people override the default-by-default here.  I suspect some system maintainers are going to want all of their machines to use X by default where X might not be the same as the default we\u0027ve put into the dbus interface.",

      "message": "Thanks for the feedback, Patrick.\n\nI initially considered setting \"link-layer\" as the default DUIDType based on the discussion in https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/issues/1280. However, I understand your point, and I agree that \"vendor\" is a more appropriate default — it aligns with systemd-networkd\u0027s default behavior and offers better consistency.\n\nIf there are no further concerns, I’d suggest proceeding with \"vendor\" as the default DUIDType — would that work for you?\n\nRegarding configuration, we plan to support changing DUIDType and IAID via `set-property` (just like other properties) or by editing the `.network` file (e.g., `00-bmc-eth0.network`). To minimize potential impact, the DUIDType/IAID logic is wrapped in a build-time flag (e.g., `#ifdef ENABLE_IPV6_DUID_IAID`) and can be explicitly disabled in the bbfile if not needed.",
