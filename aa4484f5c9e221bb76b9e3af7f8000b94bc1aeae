      "message": "It seems like we are going to have an update to the PLDM document elsewhere, but can we get an explanation on why the current model of software in xyz.openbmc_project.Software is insufficient for the problem?\n\nI feel like we keep having this discussion with PLDM.  A new feature comes out and we try to expose raw PLDM concepts onto DBus and force some other component to do a translation from real BMC concepts into PLDM concepts.  This isn\u0027t an abstraction.  I\u0027ve said it before but I don\u0027t want other software packages to know that they\u0027re talking to PLDM, or Redfish, or IPMI because when the next PLDM/Redfish/IPMI comes out we have to, once again, re-write half of our code.",
