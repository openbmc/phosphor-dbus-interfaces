If yes, then how as i don\u0027t see that support in existing Redfish interface.\n\n\u003e MultipartHttpPushUri is the thing that\u0027s going to be building state up for updates.\n\nIsn\u0027t MultipartHttpPushUri a readonly\u003dtrue property which provides the multipart URI to which the client can post the Multipart image?  As per description -\n\"This property shall contain a URI used to perform a Redfish Specification-defined Multipart HTTP or HTTPS POST of a software image\"\nHow would this help with building state up for updates?",
