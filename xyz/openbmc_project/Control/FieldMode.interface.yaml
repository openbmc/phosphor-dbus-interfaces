    An interface to enable field mode, blocking the activation of PNOR patches.

properties:
    - name: Fielded
      type: boolean
      description: >
          If set true, an environment variable will be set, indicating that the
          BMC is in field mode. When fielded, the system will no longer monitor
          the PNOR patch patch for images. Enabling field mode is intended to
          be a one-way operation.
