    Implement this to add SBE dump management.

    Self Boot Engine(SBE) is a microcontroller that sits inside the processor
    to initialize it to start the booting and also acts as a secure channel
    for accessing certain control functions on the processor. During the
    booting or other hardware access operations SBE can encounter errors
    and become unresponsive. In such situations, the debug data needs to be
    collected from such SBEs to find out the root cause of the error.
    This data includes hardware state, configuration, memory, etc.
    The collected data is then packaged into the OpenPOWER dump format
    and which is called as SBE dump.
    There will be one instance of SBE on each processor.
    Implement this interface to add support for managing the SBE dump.
