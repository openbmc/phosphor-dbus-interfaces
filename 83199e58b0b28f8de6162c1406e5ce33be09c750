It would be nice if we could get someone with some expertise in other hypervisors to help determine if these are relatively standard / safe states or if they are IBM/PowerVM-specific.

I think OPAL at least has the Safe/Runtime concept.",

I think OPAL at least has the Safe/Runtime concept.\nOPAL is not really an hypervisor per-se, it just boots Linux who then acts as an hypervisor.\n\nI\u0027m not yet sufficiently acquainted with Redfish to review this properly, but I wanted to point out:\n\n1) In OPAL we do use \"IPMI override\" bootdev such as diag, safe, disk, network etc. When we are requested a \"safe\" boot we just don\u0027t probe the disks (this will usually stall boot unless you have prepared a static configuration on the nvram). Not sure if that maps cleanly to \u0027safe\u0027.\n\n2) Also regarding IPMI, we reset the boot counter sensor on successful boot\n\n3) I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027d do with this information.. i.e., in OPAL mode, would we monitor this? What would we do if this signals a transition to Runtime? I don\u0027t have an \"Idle\" state other than powered off, or auto-boot cancelled/failed perhaps\n\n4) Feels strange that we allow transitions from None to Runtime but apparently not the other way around.. Again, for OPAL/Linux, this is probably analogous with poweron/poweroff",

Like you said, in most cases you just do the normal power off path of the system from Runtime.",
