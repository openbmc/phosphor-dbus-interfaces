In fact we did our final implementation downstream so we didn\u0027t force it on every other user of this repo.\n\nWhat if another user shipping systems is already happy with the current implementation and changing it would lead to angry customers?\n\nI don\u0027t know what to do about these issues...  Provide a way to select which handler to run?",
