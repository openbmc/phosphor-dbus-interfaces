    'Applications may implement the MeetsMinimumShipLevel (MSL) decorator on an
    object in the inventory namespace to denote that the item does or does not
    meet an implementation defined minimum level for shipment requirement.

    There are no requirements on how implementations react to inventory items
    that do or do not meet the MSL.  Typical reactions might be to prevent a
    system from powering on or logging events.'
