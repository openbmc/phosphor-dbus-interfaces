          It can be utilized to disable synchronization when the redundant BMC
          is in a faulty state.

          It does not interrupt ongoing sync operations. If the redundant BMC
          network is unstable, the ongoing sync operation will fail and attempt
          retries. However, it will not proceed if this property value is set to
          true.
