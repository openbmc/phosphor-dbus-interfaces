    Implement to notify the creation of new dump. This interface is used when a
    dump is already created and ready to be offloaded. This interface will
    update an existing dump object or add a new one with the provided
    properties. The existing create interface should be used when the data is
    being collected and the dump needs to be packaged.

    Specifically for IBM OpenPOWER systems, dumps are collected and stored in
    the host. Post dump completion, the host notifies via PLDM, which calls this
    interface with dump type, dump source id (an id assigned by the host and
    used for all communication with the host), and the size of the newly created
    dump.

    Any OpenBMC implementation must provide exactly one implementation of
    com.ibm.Dump.Notify on /xyz/openbmc_project/dump.

                The dump id provided by the source of the dump. In IBM OpenPOWER
                systems, some types of dumps are generated and stored in the
                host memory. All dumps have a unique id, but when communicating
                to the source of the dump, the SourceDumpId will be used.

                Sometimes the dump is created in the host based on the request
                from the user, such requests come through the BMC first and then
                get forwarded to host in such cases host will be sending a token
                to identify the dump request. If the token is not valid it
                should be defaulted to 0.
