          A mapping from sensor name to a string describing the reason for that
          sensor's current fail-safe state within this zone. Sensors are added
          to this map when they are detected as failed, and removed automatically
          when they recover. The reason string provides a brief description of
          the failure condition (for example, a bad reading or a timeout).
          An empty map indicates that all sensors are currently healthy.
