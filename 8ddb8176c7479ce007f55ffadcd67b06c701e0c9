      "message": "I have plans to use this interface property in phosphor-user-manager to configure\nuser account password expiration date. The user password expiration date contains in the file /etc/shadow and can be modified by using the \"chage\" command.\nShadow provides the opportunity for each user to have their own password expiration date. So I think it is a good idea to add the \"PasswordExpiration\" property in the \"Attributes\" and use it in the \"Users\" class from the phosphor-user-manager service.",

If you use a date you have all sorts of timezone considerations that need to be made, which leads to ambiguity in the interface.
