I do like the idea of having different paths for the primary/secondary flash banks, that\u0027d allow the same fw version to be installed on a system on both banks.\n\nAlso what should the device name be? should it be the actual name of the device/volume like mtd0, mmcblk0, ubi0_0, or some arbitrary name, or both depending if it\u0027s a bmc device or host?",

Not neccesarily the underlying BMC device name (ie. \"ubi0_0\").  Do you think I should add anything to the wording here?",
