    Implement to provide control of a voltage regulator.  Objects implementing
    Control.VoltageRegulatorControl allow for fine grained control of a given
    voltage regulator rail, and allows external entities to control Voltage
    Regulator devices.

properties:
    - name: Voltage
      type: double
      description: >
          The current voltage setting for the voltage regulator rail.
    - name: MaxValue
      type: double
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The Maximum supported voltage.
    - name: MinValue
      type: double
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The Minimum supported voltage.
    - name: Resolution
      type: double
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The minimum step size supported by this voltage interface.
    - name: RailType
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: >
          The voltage regulator rail type, such as 'vdd', 'vcc', or 'vio'.  The
          data type of this property is a string rather than an enumeration
          because rail types are often system-specific.
