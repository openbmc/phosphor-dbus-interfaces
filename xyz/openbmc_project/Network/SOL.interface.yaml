    SOL properties use for Get/Set SOL config parameter command in host-ipmid
    sending config to SOL process in net-ipmid.
    Since some platforms need to access Get/Set SOL config parameter command
    through KCS, and current sol manager is implemented in net-ipmid and
    cannot be accessed by host-ipmid, add a dbus interface for host-ipmid
    command to transfer properties to net-ipmid.
    This interface will be implemented in phosphor-settings.
