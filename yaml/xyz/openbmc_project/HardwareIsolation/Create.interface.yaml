    This interface contains create method, which can be implemented to
    create an xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry object
    which will use to provide the information of isolated hardware.

methods:
    - name: Create
      description: >
          Create an xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry object
          if any of the hardware, needs to be isolated. This interface
          can be used if want to isolate hardware without an error log,
          for example, the user voluntarily tried to isolate hardware.
      parameters:
        - name: IsolateHardware
          type: path
          description: >
              The hardware inventory path which is needs to isolate.
        - name: Severity
          type: enum[xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry.Type]
          description: >
              The severity of isolating hardware.
      returns:
        - name: Path
          type: path
          description: >
              The path of created xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry
              object.
      errors:
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InvalidArgument
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.TooManyResources

    - name: CreateWithErrorLog
      description: >
          Create an xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry object
          if any of the hardware, needs to be isolated. This interface
          can be used if the system wants to isolate hardware with
          an error log that is caused to isolate hardware.
