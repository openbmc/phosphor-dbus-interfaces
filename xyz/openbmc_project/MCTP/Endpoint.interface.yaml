    Describe an MCTP endpoint. It is an MCTP communication terminus. An MCTP
    endpoint is a terminus or origin of MCTP packets or messages. The combined
    functionality within a physical device that communicates using the MCTP
    transport protocol and handles MCTP control commands. This includes
    MCTP-capable management controllers and managed devices. MCTP bridges are
    not modelled on the D-Bus. This interface will be typically implemented by
    the MCTP control process daemon alias mcptd and aids in the discovery of
    MCTP enabled devices by higher layer protocols (like PLDM, SPDM) which are
    implemented in the userspace. The D-Bus object path that implements this
    interface will be typically named xyz/openbmc_project/mctp/endpointN where
    N is a unique number and does not correspond to the actual endpoint ID.
    There will be a D-Bus object for every endpoint that is discovered by the
    mctpd. The object may also optionally implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Common.UUID interface to address the requirement for
    devices with multiple endpoints and for hot-plug devices. The lifetime of
    the D-Bus object is the lifetime of the connected MCTP device. The higher
    layer protocols like PLDM will depend on this D-Bus interface to do
    discovery of MCTP endpoints that support PLDM using SupportedMessageTypes
    property and then initiate a PLDM discovery flow. Also mctpd discovers the
    removal of the MCTP devices, removes the D-Bus objects and allows upper
    layer protocols to take appropriate actions.

properties:

    - name: EID
      type: byte
      description: >
          The logical address used to route MCTP messages to a specific MCTP
          endpoint. A numeric handle (logical address) that uniquely identifies
          a particular MCTP endpoint within a system for MCTP communication and
          message routing purposes. Endpoint IDs are unique among MCTP
          endpoints that comprise an MCTP communication network within a
          system. MCTP EIDs are only unique within a particular MCTP network.
          That is, they can be duplicated or overlap from one MCTP network to
          the next. This is also referred to as "endpoint ID" and abbreviated
          as "EID".

    - name: SupportedMessageTypes
      type: array[byte]
      description: >
          List of MCTP message types supported by the MCTP endpoint. MCTP
          message type is an enumeration that identifies the type of the
          communication payload in an MCTP message. The well defined message
          types are MCTP Control(0x00), PLDM(0x01), NC-SI over MCTP(0x02),
          Ethernet over MCTP(0x03), NVM Express Management Messages over
          MCTP(0x04) and SPDM over MCTP(0x05). There are ranges for vendor
          defined message types. All the message types are specified in the
          DSP0239 specification. A device that supports a given message type
          may not support that message type equally across all buses that
          connect to the device.
