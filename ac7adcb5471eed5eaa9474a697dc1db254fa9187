      "message": "Wonder if \u003cid\u003e/\u003cdevice\u003e should be the default going forward, it\u0027d apply to single devices too and would make it more consistent instead of having different number of path levels. I do like the idea of having different paths for the primary/secondary flash banks, that\u0027d allow the same fw version to be installed on a system on both banks.\n\nAlso what should the device name be? should it be the actual name of the device/volume like mtd0, mmcblk0, ubi0_0, or some arbitrary name, or both depending if it\u0027s a bmc device or host?",
