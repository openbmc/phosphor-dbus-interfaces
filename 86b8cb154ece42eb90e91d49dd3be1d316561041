      "message": "WriteProtected seems more like a property or characteristic, not necessarily a state? Just seems to me that if i were to query the state of a fw version, i\u0027d expect it to have values of active, or invalid, staged, etc, not to describe the characteristic of the version such as if it\u0027s write protected, or redundant, etc.\n\nDoes write protected overlap with updatable? The description for updatable almost sounds like it\u0027s describing a read-only version (\"for reporting purposes only\") and therefore it\u0027s write protected. Maybe we don\u0027t need this one?",

      "message": "You mentioned that this property would replace the updatable association \"and gather the different states in one place.\"\n\nWhy is a replacement needed? There are other apps querying the associations interface to find out the properties of the version, such as if it\u0027s functional, updatable, etc. I\u0027d be a bit hesitant on moving one or more associations to a different interface without a reason.\n\nDescription of the associations here:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/architecture/code-update/code-update.md#associations",
