    Implement to fetch the state effecter PDRs. PDRs are Platform Descriptor
    Records which are the collection of information that includes semantic
    and association information. The state effecter PDR is used to provide
    information about the PLDM Composite State Effecter.

    This API would be used by PLDM Requester apps on the BMC.

    An implementation of this interface should maintain the primary PDR repository
    on the BMC.
    A OpenBMC implementation must provide exactly one implementation of
    xyz.openbmc_project.PLDM.PDR on /xyz/openbmc_project/pldm.

    More information about PDR can be found at DSP0248 version 1.2.0 section 25.


methods:
    - name: FindStateEffecterPDR
      description: >
          Obtain the state effecter PDR, for the input TID,
          entity type and state set id.
          More than one PDR can be returned.

          When the PDR for the given input TID, entity type
          and state set id is not found, then the
          xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.ResourceNotFound exception will be thrown.

      parameters:
        - name: TID
          type: byte

            A terminus id.

            Identifies whether the Entity is a logical or physical Entity, and

            Array of State Effecter PDRs, where a PDR is an array[uint8_t].
