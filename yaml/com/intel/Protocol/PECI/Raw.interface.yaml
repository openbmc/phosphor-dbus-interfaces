    Implement to provide D-Bus raw PECI access to the CPU.

methods:
    - name: Send
      description: >
          Send raw PECI command(s) to the CPU
      parameters:
          - name: device
            type: string
            description: >
                The path for the PECI device to use for the command
          - name: commands
            type: array[array[byte]]
            description: >
                An array of byte arrays where each byte array holds the raw
                bytes for a single PECI command.  The larger array allows
                sending multiple PECI commands in a single transaction.
      returns:
          - name: results
            type: array[array[byte]]
            description: >
                An array of byte arrays where each byte array holds the raw
                bytes for a single PECI response corresponding to the command in
                the command array.
