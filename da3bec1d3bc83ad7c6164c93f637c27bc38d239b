You usually have a manufacturer for the card, which would be the Asset, and a manufacturer for the PCIe chip, which would be here.\n\nIf it is (2), we may have some Redfish interface impacts and a few others but I suspect those are minor.  We likely have impacts to entity-manager and a few misc provider repositories (smbios-mdr, peci-pcie).",
