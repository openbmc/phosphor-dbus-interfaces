description: >
    Implement to provide detail on type of the sensor. Each property in the
    interface maps to a distinct group of sensor subtypes.

    Objects implementing Sensor.Type must also implement Sensor.Value.

properties:
    - name: ReadingBasis
      type: enum[self.ReadingBasisType]
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          Defines the type of the sensor based on how the sensor reading is
          determined.

    - name: Implementation
      type: enum[self.ImplementationType]
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          Defines the type of the sensor based on how the sensor reading is
          obtained.

enumerations:
    - name: ReadingBasisType

          Types of the sensors based on how their reading is determined.
      values:
          - name: Headroom
            description: >
                Indicates that the reading decreases in value as it approaches
                the reference point. If the value crosses the reference point,
                the value may be reported as a negative number, or may report a
                value of zero.

          Types of the sensors based on how their reading is obtained.
      values:
          - name: PhysicalSensor
            description: >
                Indicates that the reading is obtained from a physical sensor.
          - name: Synthesized
            description: >
                Indicates that the reading is obtained by applying a calculation
                on one or more properties of multiple sensors.
          - name: Reported
            description: >
                Indicates that the reading is reported to the management
                controller by a managed device.
