description: >
    Implement this interface to capture dump pieces stored in some
    locations. Use this interface once dump files are collected
    and need to be packaged as a dump package. If the dump id
    is provided the captured dump will be added to the corresponding
    dump object, otherwise a new dump object will be created.

    Any OpenBMC implementation must provide exactly one implementation of
    xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Capture on /xyz/openbmc_project/dump.
