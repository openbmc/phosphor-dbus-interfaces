      "message": "Hi @Deepak,\n\nApologies, Somehow I have missed your comments, and sorry for the very very late response.\n\nAgree with you regarding the below points.\n\n- ID\nYes, it can be implementation-specific and it can be part of the path.\nThe original proposal in design documents used a separate property but, when I have started the implementation, figure out that id can be part of the path. Fixed in the latest patch.\n\n- ErrorLog and IsolatedHardware\nYes, it can be an association in this entry object, recently I got to knew that there is an association concept while watching discord and I felt the same as you said, it can be an association to point error log and isolated hardware inventory path. Fixed in the latest patch.\n\n- Severity\nSeverity can be an association? Not getting your point can you elaborate?\n\nI am not sure you mean the severity of the error log? \n\nHere I am referring, the severity of isolated hardware which will vary from error log severity (I guess) so I thought it can be separate property in this entry to get to know about the severity/type of isolated hardware entry.",
