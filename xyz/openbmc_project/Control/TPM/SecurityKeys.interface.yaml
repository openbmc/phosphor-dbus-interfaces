          This is a bit mask used to specify clearing different security keys
          or resetting those values back to default by the host. Setting this
          property does not guarantee a successful operation as additional
          conditions will be checked by the host to clear/reset the sensitive
          data. Some of customer usecases include clearing OS platform key,
          clearing system security officer certificate and resetting the
          system key value back to its default state.
