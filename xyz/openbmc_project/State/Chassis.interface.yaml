    Implement to provide the chassis power management

properties:
    - name: RequestedPowerTransition
      type: enum[self.Transition]
      default: 'Off'
      description: >
          The desired power transition to start on this chassis.
          This will be preserved across AC power cycles of the BMC.

    - name: CurrentPowerState
      type: enum[self.PowerState]
      description: >
          A read-only property describing the current chassis power state.
          A user can determine if a chassis is in transition by comparing
          the CurrentPowerState and RequestedPowerTransition properties.

    - name: LastStateChangeTime
      type: uint64
      description: >
          The last time at which the chassis power changed state, as
          tracked by the CurrentPowerState property, in epoch time,
          in milliseconds.  This can be used to tell when the chassis
          was last powered on or off.

enumerations:
    - name: Transition
      description: >
        The desired power transition for the chassis
      values:
        - name: 'Off'
          description: >
            Chassis  power should be off
        - name: 'On'
          description: >
            Chassis power should be on

    - name: PowerState
      description: >
        The current state of the chassis power
      values:
        - name: 'Off'
          description: >
            Chassis power is off
        - name: 'On'
          description: >
            Chassis power is on
