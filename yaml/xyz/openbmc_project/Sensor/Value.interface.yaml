    Implement to provide sensor readings.  Objects implementing Sensor.Value
    must be instantiated in the correct hierarchy within the sensors
    namespace.  The following sensor hierarchies are recognized:
      airflow
      altitude
      current
      energy
      fan_tach
      humidity
      power
      pressure
      temperature
      utilization
      voltage

    Any service implementing Sensor.Value on one or more objects must implement
    org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors.

    All Sensor.Value properties are read-only.
