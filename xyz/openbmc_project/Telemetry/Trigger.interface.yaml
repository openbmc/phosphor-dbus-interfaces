description: >
    Implement this interface to provide trigger inspection features. An
    implementation service should additionaly implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete for deletion of individual trigger.

properties:
  - name: Discrete
    type: boolean
    description: >
        If true than trigger uses discrete thresholds as threshold conditions.
        Otherwise numeric thresholds is used.
    flags:
    - const
  - name: LogToJournal
    type: boolean
    description: >
        Defines if trigger logs to system journal when threshold conditions are
        met. LogToJournal is a trigger action.
    flags:
    - const
  - name: LogToRedfish
    type: boolean
    description: >
        Defines if trigger logs Redfish message when threshold conditions are
        met. LogToRedfish is a trigger action.
    flags:
    - const
  - name: UpdateReport
    type: boolean
    description: >
        Defines if trigger updates report when threshold conditions are
        met. Reports that will be updated are specified in ReportNames property.
        UpdateReport is a trigger action.
    flags:
    - const
  - name: Persistent
    type: boolean
    description: Defines if Trigger is stored in non volatile memory.
  - name: ReportNames
    type: array[string]
    description: >
        Collection of report names that are updated when threshold conditions
        are met. List is ignored if UpdateReport property is false.
  - name: Sensors
    type: array[struct[object_path, string]]
    description: >
        Array of sensors that is monitored within trigger. First parameter of a
        structure is a sensor path. Second parameter is a metadata that is used
        to store user data about sensor.
  - name: Thresholds
    type: variant[array[struct[enum[self.Type],enum[self.Direction],uint64,double]],array[struct[string,enum[self.Severity],uint64,double]]]
    description: >
        First type in variant is a collection of numeric thresholds that has
        following fields - type, direction, dwell time and threshold value.
        Second type holds by variant is a collection of discrete thresholds that
        contains following fields - user id, severity, dwell time and threshold
        value. Numeric threshold array is limited by Type enumeration, only 4
        elements are allowed. Discrete threshold array size is not limited. If
        Discrete threshold array is empty than every value change is taken into
        account of threshold condition. Dwell time specify for how long
        condition has to persist to trigger an action.

enumerations:
  - name: Type
    description: Defines message type for trigger action.
    values:
      - name: LowerCritical
      - name: LowerWarning
      - name: UpperWarning
      - name: UpperCritical
  - name: Direction
    description: >
        Defines in which direction threshold value is crossed to commit a
        trigger action.
    values:
      - name: Either
        description: Crossing threshold value always triggers an action.
      - name: Decreasing
        description: >
            Action is commited when threshold value is crossed and previous
            sensor value was greater then threshold value.
      - name: Increasing
        description: >
            Action is commited when threshold value is crossed and previous
            sensor value was less then threshold value.
  - name: Severity
    description: Defines message severity for trigger actions.
    values:
      - name: OK
      - name: Warning
      - name: Critical
