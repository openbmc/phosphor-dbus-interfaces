      "message": "Correct, these are only used in the report/commit/elog interfaces.  I wanted to give you awareness in case I was missing anything.\n\nMy recollection is that these are all \"optional\" in that nothing will fail to compile but it will cause additional work on the log_manager if one is committed without the correct metadata.  This code seems to back that up:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-logging/blob/a2d7b7750ce7a93b1cc785f568acfb69c1ca01b1/log_manager.cpp#L188\n\nI\u0027ll go ahead and make a fix in NM, but I think it can be merged after this one and not a hard co-req.  Agreed?",
