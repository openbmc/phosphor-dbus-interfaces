      "message": "That\u0027s kind of an unfortunate implementation because these parts aren\u0027t actually \"settings\".  Maybe we should have split these into two interfaces?  One held by Settings and one held by OCC.Control?  Or maybe these should be moved out of settings?\n\nThis can be merged now as-is, but it would be good to think about some refactoring here.",
