    Implement to provide reports management.
    Provides report limitation and functions for adding reports.
methods:
-   name: AddReport
    description: >-
        The AddReport method is used to create metric report. The report may contain
        single or multiple sensor readings.
    parameters:
    -   name: name
        type: string
        description: Defines the name of reading report to be exposed over D-Bus
    -   name: domain
        type: string
        description: Defines the domain for which reading report will be collected
    -   name: reportingType
        type: string
        description: |-
            Reporting type:
            'Periodic' - For periodic update
            'OnChange' - For update when value changes
            'OnRequest' - For update when user requests data
    -   name: reportAction
        type: array[string]
        description: |-
            Any combination of two strings:
            'Log' - report shall be stored by the MonitoringService for later retrieval via the Redfish API
            'Event' - report shall be sent as an event or telemetry stream.
    -   name: scanPeriod
        type: uint32
        description: Scan period used when Periodic type is set (in milliseconds)
    -   name: metrics
        type: array[struct[array[path],string,string,string]]
        description: Collection of metric parameters.
    returns:
    -   name: report
        type: string
        description: >-
            String for created report - ie. '/xyz/openbmc_project/MonitoringService/Reports/{Domain}/{Name}'
properties:
-   name: MaxReports
    type: uint32
    description: >-
        The MaxReports property of the xyz.openbmc_project.MonitoringService.ReportsManagement
        interface contains the max number of metric reports supported by the Monitoring
        Service. This property is added to be compliant with the Redfish Telemetry
        Service schema, that contains MaxReports property.
    flags:
    - const
-   name: PollRateResolution
    type: uint32
    description: |-
        scanPeriod for Periodic reportingType should be:
        'x % PollRateResolution == 0 && x >= PollRateResolution'
    flags:
    - const
