    An MCTP Network may provide an MCTP Network ID that can be used to
    differentiate different MCTP Networks when more than one MCTP Network can be
    accessed by an entity such as system software. The Network ID is also used
    when an entity has more than one point of access to the MCTP Network. In
    this case, the MCTP Network ID enables the entity to tell whether the access
    points provide access to the same MCTP Network or to different MCTP
    Networks.

    A system implementation can contain multiple MCTP Networks. Each MCTP
    Network has its own separate EID space. There is no coordination of EIDs
    between MCTP Networks. EIDs can overlap between MCTP Networks.

          A unique identifier to distinguish each independent MCTP network
          within a platform.
