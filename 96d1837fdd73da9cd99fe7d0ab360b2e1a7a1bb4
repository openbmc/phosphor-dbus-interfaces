      "message": "`SPDMEnabled`: SPDMEnabled is not just a feature toggle. Enabling this changes the trust model of the platform. So IMO, SPDM must be explicitly enabled by the platform owner or provisioning authority(it can be BIOS/TEE or an external verifier like HMC), as initiating SPDM exchanges affects device trust establishment. Hence disabled this by default.\n\n`SPDMSecureSessionEnabled`: Establishing SPDM secure sessions is usually downstream device-dependent and must be explicitly enabled where encrypted device communication is required. In general many SPDM deployments utilize SPDM solely for authentication and measurement retrieval not for secure communication. Hence disabled this by default as well.\n\n`SPDMVerifyCertificate`: In general , certificate validation is performed by an external attestation. The BMC can operate as a conduit for SPDM evidence without acting as the root of trust. So BMC itself acting as a verifier is less typical. Hence made it disabled by default.\n\n`SPDMAllowExtendedAlgorithms`: The requester advertises only the baseline SPDM algorithm set required for interoperability.Extended algorithms may be explicitly enabled to satisfy platform-specific cryptographic or regulatory requirements. Enabling this option expands the negotiated cryptographic surface. Hence made this disabled by default as well.",

A patchable policy allows an operator or external policy authority to explicitly state “SPDM must not be used”, even if the feature is present and enabled in the implementation.\n\nThis supports valid scenarios such as security lockdowns, vulnerability mitigation, regulatory compliance, or staged provisioning, where SPDM must be temporarily or intentionally disabled without removing the feature itself. \n\nI think that redfish does not guarantee that a policy configuration results in a usable protocol; it guarantees that *policy intent* can be expressed and enforced deterministically. So including `NONE` as a valid, patchable value is intentional and consistent with other Redfish security policies (for example, TLS cipher policies in the secure policy schema), even if it results in SPDM being effectively disabled.",
