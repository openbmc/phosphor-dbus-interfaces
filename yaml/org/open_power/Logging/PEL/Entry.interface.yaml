          Hidden Error - This flag allows events to be placed in a system, but
          remain hidden from the customer. This event log is visible to
          development personnel only, e.g. hardware recovered error, etc. No
          service action is required for this type of errors. In general, when
          this value is used, the Error Action Flags has the value of
          "Hidden Error". An event log with this value is used primarily for
          error thresholding design/code debug or as a record to indicate an
          error frequency or trend.
