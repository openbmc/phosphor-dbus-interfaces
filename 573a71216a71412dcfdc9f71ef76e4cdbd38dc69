      "message": "Yes, I did, there is just one transition from 1 to 2 (which means SecondaryFlashBoot), not from 2 to 1  plus I\u0027m trying to say it will get it post factum, not in the time or before of transition, what happens if it doesn\u0027t load to linux rootfs/stuck at uboot or somewhere early in code? You just will not know if this transition succeeded or ever happens. And if happens switch back from 2 to 1, does it \"PrimaryFlashBoot\" or maybe enum \"FlashBootSource\" with \"Primary\" and \"Secondary\"? And what I see from 82793 that on write happens only on boot, if manual/auto switch happens from 1 to 2 and it won\u0027t back - nobody will see this message.",
