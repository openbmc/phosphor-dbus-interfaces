    This interface defines methods and properties required for Time-based
    One-time Password (TOTP) multi-factor authentication at user level to
    support multi-factor authentication secret key setup for each user. This
    interface implemented by each user object to support TOTP based
    authenticators like google, microsoft, etc.

methods:
    - name: CreateSecretKey
      description: >
