    Implement to capture various types of dumps from the
    host or BMC. This interface is for user to request a particular
    type of dump.

    Any OpenBMC implementation should provide one implementation
    of xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Create per dump type on
    /xyz/openbmc_project/dump/<dump type>. On multi-host or on multi-BMC
    systems the instance number can be added to the path to differentiate,
    for example /xyz/openbmc_project/dump/<dump type><instance-id>.


methods:
    - name: CreateDump

      parameters:
        - name: AdditionalData

          description: >
            The additional data, if any, for initiating the dump
            e.g.:
              {
                "key1": "value1",
                "key2": "value2"
              }
            ends up in AdditionaData like:
              ["KEY1=value1", "KEY2=value2"]
      returns:
        - name: Id
          type: uint32

            The Dump entry id number.
