    An interface to set whether the power supplies are redundant.
properties:
    - name: PowerSupplyRedundancyEnabled
      type: boolean
      flags:
        - const
      description: >
          When true, the power supplies are redundant.
    - name: RotationEnabled
      type: boolean
      description: >
        Cold redundancy rotation enabled or not.
    - name: RotationAlgorithm
      type: byte
      description: >
        Rotation algorithm use for cold redundancy. 0 is BMC Specific, 1 is User Specific.
    - name: RotationRankOrder
      type: array[byte]
      description: >
        The rank order for each PSU. 0 means will not go into cold standby state.
    - name: PeriodOfRotation
      type: uint32
      description: >
        Rotation Period for cold redundancy. If rotation algorithm is BMC Specific,
        and rotation is enabled, BMC will change PSU rank order after this time.
    - name: ColdRedundancyStatus
      type: byte
      description: >
        Cold redundancy setting status, set in progress or set completed.
