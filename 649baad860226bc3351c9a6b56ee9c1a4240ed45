The StaticRoute commit https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/60517\n\nStatic route takes Destination IP address and the Gateway IP in the system which should be used to reach that destination. \nStatic gateway is to create the gateway itself for the interface. This takes the Gateway IP, protocol, and the Prefix length as inputs. \n\nThis dbus interface is to add multiple static gateways for the static IPv6 network setup. \n\nSo I believe combining them may lead to confusions.",

      "message": "I’m having trouble understanding the difference.\n\nIt seems your proposal is missing the destination IP, right?  This should always be implied to be a mask of sorts since the prefix length is applied. 0.0.0.0 is the destination you’d use for “everything”.  I must be missing the understanding on how your proposal works without a destination unless it is always implied to be “gateway \u0026 prefix_mask”?  That seems… undocumented and weaker in functionality. \n\nOther than that, what is the difference you see?  What is the expected confusion you envision from one to the other?",
