    Implement to provide warning class sensor thresholds.  Objects implementing
    Sensor.Threshold.Warning must be instantiated in the correct hierarchy within 
    the sensors namespace.  The following sensor hierarchies are recognized:
      temperature
      fan_tach
      voltage
      altitude

    Additionally, any object implementing Sensor.Threshold.Warning must also
    implement Sensor.Value.

properties:
    - name: High
      type: i
      description: >
          The upper bound of the warning threshold.
    - name: Low
      type: i
      description: >
          The lower bound of the warning threshold.
    - name: Alarm
      type: b
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bounds.
          False if the sensor value has not exceeded the defined bounds.

          Alarm may be set to False to clear an alarm condition.  The behavior
          of setting Alarm to True is undefined.
