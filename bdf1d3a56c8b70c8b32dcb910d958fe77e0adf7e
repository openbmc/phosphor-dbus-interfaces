      "message": "Are you suggesting to append them to this enum list ? or replace the exiting options with these ?\n\nThese terms seems have different meanings based on the power management techniques used as far as i investigated. But i understood the following gist, let me know if something is wrong or if there is a better documentation.\n\ncycle/working state - device is completely powered on and is usable\n\nsleep state - low power idle mode (aka standby power) - where the device is powered on but running in low power mode, and can wake up due to some real time action on the device.\n\nsoftoff state - system is completely shutdown, but the power is on ?\n\nhardoff state - aka \"mechanical off\" where machine is completely off and power is removed.",
