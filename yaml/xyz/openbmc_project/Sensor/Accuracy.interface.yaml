    Implement to provide accuracy for sensor readings.

    All Sensor.Accuracy properties are read-only.

          The accuracy range (+/-) of the sensor Value as a percentage, with a
          value between 0 and 100.
          This is NOT a percentage of the sensor value ranges.
          A value of 0.25 would be 0.25%, a value of 2 would represent 2%.
          A value of 2 for 2% would mean that a reading of 10 would have an
          actual value of 9.8 to 10.2.
