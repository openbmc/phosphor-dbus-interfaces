# Session Management

## Overview

IPMI RMCP+ sessions are created and maintained by phosphor-ipmi-net daemon,
whereas we need to provide details about the same using phosphor-ipmi-host.
Hence IPMI RMCP+ session details has to be exposed through D-Bus interface, so
that both phosphor-ipmi-host & phosphr-ipmi-net will be in sync.
