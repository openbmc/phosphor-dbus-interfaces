Anytime we have a property name that can is only descriptive enough when it contains \u003e 16 characters probably indicates a scoping problem, hence why I originally suggested a separate PasswordPolicy interface.  The map property solves it similarly.\n\nYou can pick which you want to go.  I think that a map makes it more obvious when we are using the default value (because the value is absent from the map) but is a little harder to interact with because it requires a read-modify-write of the property to add a new policy setting.  The map is nicer for clients, I think, though because it is a single property to read.\n\nIf you go with a PasswordPolicy interface, probably keep them as separate properties.",
