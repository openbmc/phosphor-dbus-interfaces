    Implement to specify a derating factor on power supply
    The power supply derating factor represents the efficiency of the
    power supplies. For example, if the power supply derating factor is 90,
    then that implies the power supply loses 10 percent of the drawn power.
    This derating factor is taken into account when a power cap is applied
    to the system.
