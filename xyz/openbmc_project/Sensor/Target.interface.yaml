    Implement to provide writing to a sensor.  Objects implementing
    Sensor.Target must be instantiated in the correct
    hierarchy within the sensors namespace.  The following sensor
    hierarchies are recognized:
      fan_tach
      fan_pwm

    Any service implementing Sensor.Target on one or more objects must
    implement org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on the sensors namespace root.

    All Sensor.Target properties are read/write.

properties:
    - name: Target
      type: int64
      description: >
          The sensor target value.
    - name: Unit
      type: enum[self.Unit]
      description: >
          The unit of the sensor write.
          For objects in the fan_tach namespace, Unit must be "RPMS".
          For objects in the fan_pwm namespace, Unit must be "PWMS".

enumerations:
    - name: Unit
      description: >
        A sensor write unit.
      values:
        - name: RPMS
          description: >
            Frequency of rotation as revolutions per minute.
        - name: PWMS
          description: >
            Frequency of rotation as pulse width modulations.
