    Implement to provide sensor readings.  Objects implementing
    Sensor.Value must be instantiated in the correct
    hierarchy within the sensors namespace.  The following sensor
    hierarchies are recognized:
      temperature
      fan_tach
      voltage
      altitude
      current
      power
      energy

    Any service implementing Sensor.Value on one or more objects must
    implement org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on the sensors namespace root.

    All Sensor.Value properties are read-only.

properties:
    - name: Value
      type: int64
      description: >
          The sensor reading.
    - name: MaxValue
      type: int64
      description: >
          The Maximum supported sensor reading.
    - name: MinValue
      type: int64
      description: >
          The Minimum supported sensor reading.
    - name: Unit
      type: enum[self.Unit]
      description: >
          The unit of the reading.  Immutable once set for a sensor.
          For objects in the temperature namespace, Unit must be "DegreesC".
          For objects in the fan_tach namespace, Unit must be "RPMS".
          For objects in the voltage namespace, Unit must be "Volts".
          For objects in the altitude namespace, Unit must be "Meters".
          For objects in the current namespace, Unit must be "Amperes".
          For objects in the power namespace, Unit must be "Watts".
          For objects in the energy namespace, Unit must be "Joules".
    - name: Scale
      type: int64
      description: >
          The reading scaling factor N, where the actual reading is Value * 10^N.
          This is immutable once set for a sensor.
