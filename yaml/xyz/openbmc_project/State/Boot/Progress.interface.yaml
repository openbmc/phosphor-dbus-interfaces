          BootProgressLastUpdate is the last time the BootProgress
          property was updated. The time is the Epoch time, number
          of microseconds since 1 Jan 1970 00::00::00 UTC.
          This can be compared with the current BootProgress value
          to know how long the boot has been on the current boot step.
