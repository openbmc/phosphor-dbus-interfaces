      "message": "I don\u0027t really understand what this commit is proposing.  Log entries aren\u0027t \"Redfish\" or \"SEL\" as it is.  They can be transposed into Redfish events or SELs, but they are *not* those things and never were intended to be those things.  Likely they contain a superset of information that those external interfaces might want.\n\nI don\u0027t think we should expect a logging entry to say \"I want to be surfaced out this particular external interface\".\n\nWhat would we do for existing logging entries?",
