    Implement to provide event/error entry attributes.
    This interface should be instantiated for the phosphor::logging namespace.
    This interface is a collection of objects, therefore it is required to
    implement org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on the logging namespace root.
    Optionally, implement org.openbmc.Object.Delete to allow the deletion of
    individual entries.
properties:
    - name: Id
      type: i

          The error event entry id number.
    - name: Severity
      type: s
      description: >
          The severity of the error event entry.
    - name: Message
