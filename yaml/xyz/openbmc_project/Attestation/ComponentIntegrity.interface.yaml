description: >
    Implement to represent component integrity information acquired from a
    secure authentication or measurement of the protected components. A trusted
    component (e.g., iRoT or TPM) is typically involved to provide the info
    using a security protocol (e.g., SPDM).

properties:
    - name: Enabled
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: >
          An indication of whether security protocols are enabled for the
          component.

    - name: Type
      type: enum[self.SecurityTechnologyType]
      default: Unknown
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The type of security technology for the component.

    - name: TypeVersion
      type: string
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The version of the security technology. Human readable format, e.g.
          "1.1" for SPDM.

    - name: LastUpdated
      type: uint64
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The date and time when information for the component was last updated.
          Firmware update, device certificate change or other device state
          change that leads to component integrity change should update this
          date. It is represented in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
    - name: SecureSessionType
      type: enum[self.SecureSessionType]
      default: Unknown
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The type of session or communication channel between two components.
    - name: SessionId
      type: uint32
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The identifier for an active session or communication channel between
          two components.

associations:
    - name: authenticating
      description: >
          Objects that implement ComponentIntegrity can implement the
          "authenticating" association to provide a link to the target component
          whose integrity this resource authenticates.

enumerations:

          The security technology used for the component.
      values:
          - name: OEM
            description: >

            description: >
                A plain text session without any protection.
          - name: AuthenticatedOnly
            description: >
                An established session where only authentication is protecting
