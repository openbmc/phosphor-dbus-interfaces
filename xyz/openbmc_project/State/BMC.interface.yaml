   Implementation of BMC state management.  When rebooting we are in
   transition.  When Ready all services required are running
   successfully.  When we are Not Ready this implies not all services
   have started that are required to be.

properties:
   - name: RequestedBMCTransition

         The desired BMC transition

   - name: CurrentBMCState
     type: enum[self.BMCState]
     description: >
         The current state of the BMC and is a read-only property.

   - name: LastRebootTime
     type: uint64
     description: >
        The last time at which the BMC came out of a reboot as
        determined by its uptime, in epoch time, in milliseconds.

   - name: ModularBMCMode
     type: enum[self.ModularMode]
     description: >
        The current BMC mode in Modular systems.

   - name: ModularBMCRole
     type: enum[self.ModularRole]
     description: >
        The current BMC role in Modular system.

enumerations:
   - name: Transition
     description: >
       The desired transition for the BMC firmware
     values:
       - name: 'Reboot'
         description: >
           BMC system should be rebooted
       - name: 'None'
         description: >
           No transition is in progress

   - name: BMCState
     description: >
       The current state of the BMC firmware
     values:
       - name: 'Ready'
         description: >
           Ready implies all services started and are running successfully
       - name: 'NotReady'
         description: >
           Not ready implies not all services have started or are not running successfully
       - name: 'UpdateInProgress'
         description: >
           UpdateInProgress implies BMC is in firmware update mode. CurrentBMCState
           will be set to "UpdateInProgress" while starting image download and
           reset to Ready, once activation is done or error case during update process.

   - name: ModularMode
     description: >
       The current BMC mode in Modular systems.
     values:
       - name: 'Standalone'
         description: >
           BMC currently is working in partitioned mode. In this mode BMC will
           work as normal.
       - name: 'FourSocket'
         description: >
           BMC currently is working in 4 socket mode. In this mode, one BMC
           will work as a master and another BMC will work as a slave. And
           master BMC  is responsible for management of system level resources.
       - name: 'EightSocket'
         description: >
           BMC currently is working in 8 socket mode. In this mode, one BMC
           will work as a master and three other BMCs will work as slaves.

   - name: ModularRole
     description: >
       The current BMC role in Modular systems.
     values:
       - name: 'Master'
         description: >
           BMC now is working as a master in 4S or 8S mode.
       - name: 'Slave'
         description: >
           BMC now is working as a slave in 4S or 8S mode.
