    Implement to fetch the PDRs. PDRs are Platform Descriptor Records which are
    the collection of information that includes semantic and association
    information.

    This API would be used by PLDM Requester apps on the BMC.

    An implementation of this interface should maintain the primary PDR
    repository on the BMC.

    A OpenBMC implementation should implement the xyz.openbmc_project.PLDM.PDR
    interface on the path /xyz/openbmc_project/pldm.

    More information about PDR can be found at DSP0248 version 1.2.0 section 25.

methods:
    - name: FindStateEffecterPDR
      description: >
          Obtain the state effecter PDR, for the input TID, entity ID and state
          set id. If multiple PLDM entity instances(in state effecter PDRs)
          match the EntityId and StateSetId below,all the corresponding state
          effecter PDRs are returned. More than one PDR can be returned for the
          same state set id.

          When the PDR for the given input TID, entity id and state set id is
          not found, then the xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.ResourceNotFound
          exception will be thrown.

      parameters:

                Multiple PDRs of the format present in table 89 of DSP0248
                version 1.2.0 are returned. Each of the PDRs returned has the
