    Implement to provide discrete sensor readings.

    Any service implementing Sensor.Discrete.Operational on one or more objects must
    implement org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on /xyz/openbmc_project/discrete_sensors.

    All Sensor.Discrete.Operational properties are read-only.

properties:
    - name: Value
      type: enum[self.Value]
      description: >
          The discrete sensor reading.

enumerations:
    - name: Value
      description: >
          The discrete sensor reported operational state of the monitored object.
      values:
          - name: Operational
            description: >
                The monitored object is operating normally.
          - name: Throttled
            description: >
                The monitored object is working, but slower than usually.
          - name: Reset
            description: >
                The monitored object is in reset.
          - name: PowerNotGood
            description: >
                The monitored object has no power or the power isn't good.
          - name: Failed
            description: >
                The monitored object encountered an internal error preventing
                normal operation.
