    This interface describes the API to read information from a sibling BMC in a
    redundant configuration.

properties:
    - name: BMCPosition

      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The position the sibling BMC thinks it is.  Important on systems where
          there is an opportunity to plug hardware or cables in wrong.

    - name: FWVersion
      type: string
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The version of the firmware that the sibling is running.

    - name: Provisioned
      type: boolean
      default: false
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          If the sibling has been provisioned.

          If the sibling BMC has redundancy enabled.  This may only make sense
          if the sibling has the active role.

      default: false
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          If the sibling has failovers paused.  Redundancy is still considered
          enabled (syncs are happening). This may need to happen during certain
          events, for example during a code update. This may only make sense if
          the sibling has the active role.

          If the sibling BMC thinks it has good communication with this BMC.
          It's possible the system is wired such that one cannot imply that the
          sibling BMC can also read from this BMC just because this BMC can read
          from the sibling.

          If the redundancy management software running on the sibling BMC is
          providing a continous heartbeat indicating that it is up and running.
