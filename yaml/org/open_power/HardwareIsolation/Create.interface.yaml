    This interface contains create method, which can be implemented to
    create an org.open_power.HardwareIsolation.Entry object
    which will use to provide the information of isolated hardware.

methods:
    - name: Create
      description: >
          Create an org.open_power.HardwareIsolation.Entry object if any
          of hardware, need to be isolated.
      parameters:
        - name: IsolateHardware
          type: variant[path, array[byte], string]
          description: >
              The hardware path which is needs to isolate.
              The first type in the variant is the hardware inventory path
              for example,
              "/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/chassis/motherboard/cpu0".
              The second type in the variant is the hardware entity path which
              is key between BMC OpenPOWER based applications and
              host applications. for example,
              "23 01 00 02 00 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00".
              The Third type in the variant is the hardware physical path
              which is equivalent to entity path but, human-understandable
              format. for example, "physical:sys-0/node-0/proc-0".
              One of the types from variant can be used to isolate hardware.
        - name: Severity
          type: enum[org.open_power.HardwareIsolation.Entry.Type]
          description: >
              The severity of isolating hardware.
        - name: BmcErrorLogId
          type: uint32
          description: >
              The BMC error log caused the isolation of hardware.
              This parameter can be optional (pass 0) if the severity type
              is org.open_power.HardwareIsolation.Entry.Type.User.
      returns:
        - name: Path
          type: path
          description: >
              The path of created org.open_power.HardwareIsolation.Entry
              object.
      errors:
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InvalidArgument
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InternalFailure
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.NotAllowed
