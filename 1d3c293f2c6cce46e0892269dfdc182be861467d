      "message": "So I have kept this as a separate interface because, any dbus object can implement this interface to indicate who has initiated the activity/operation, if applicable.\nThis is because, the DMTF community also seem to need this interface for audit logs (forum thread at: https://redfishforum.com/thread/547/usage-originofcondition-parameter-logentry-schema)\n\nThis \"GeneratorId\" is needed here in the Create dump method as an additional parameter, whose value if not null, will then be populated in the dump entry dbus object.\nSo all the user initiated dumps will have this assitional parameter with the unique id as its value.",
