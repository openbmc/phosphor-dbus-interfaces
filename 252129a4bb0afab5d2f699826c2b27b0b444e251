      "message": "Good question.  Maybe I don\u0027t need this.\n\nWe seem to have a few cases:\n- The fan is spinning below thresholds.  This should be reported by dbus-sensors as a fan threshold issue.\n- The fan isn\u0027t spinning at the speed requested (or is 0).  Maybe this could be handled by thresholds also or maybe pid-control should explicitly monitor for this.\n- There are secondary hardware necessary to get the fan to work, which is raising a failure signal (usually a GPIO).  The two I see right now in our design are:\n    1. The io-expander to the fan controller isn\u0027t working and/or raised an interrupt. (I need to look at this closer because I don\u0027t think this is actually a fan failure)\n    2. There is an \"efuse\" to prevent over-current and it has blown and raised an interrupt.\n\nThe \"efuse\" one I could probably map to the power-rail failures I put in a different diff.",
