    Interface to Start and Stop a Lamp Test.
    Lamp Test is a method of testing the functionality of all the
    software controlled LEDs in the system. How this is achieved
    is left to implementations.
    One possible implementation might be to turn ON all applicable LEDs
    for a certain period of time. This enables a visual inspection of
    all the LEDs for their correctness.
