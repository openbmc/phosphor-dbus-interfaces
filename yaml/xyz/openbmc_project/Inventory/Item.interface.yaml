    Implement to provide basic item attributes.  Required by all objects
    within the inventory namespace.

    Any service implementing Inventory.Item on one or more objects must
    implement org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on
    /xyz/openbmc_project/inventory.

properties:
    - name: PrettyName
      type: string
      description: >
          The human readable name of the item.
    - name: Present
      type: boolean
      description: >
          Whether or not the item is present.

associations:
    - name: containing
      description: >
          Any inventory Items (usually Boards or Chassis) can optionally
          implement the 'containing' association to provide one or more links
          to Items which it physically contains.

          Any inventory Items can optionally implement the 'contained_by'
