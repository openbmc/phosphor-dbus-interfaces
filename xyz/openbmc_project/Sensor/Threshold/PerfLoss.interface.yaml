    Implement to provide performance loss class sensor thresholds.  Objects
    implementing Sensor.Threshold.PerfLoss must be instantiated in the correct
    hierarchy within the sensors namespace.  The following sensor hierarchies
    are recognized:
      temperature
      fan_tach
      voltage
      altitude
      current
      power
      energy


    Additionally, any object implementing Sensor.Threshold.PerfLoss must also
    implement Sensor.Value.

properties:
    - name: PerfLossHigh
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The upper bound of the warning threshold.  A value of 'NaN' is used
          to indicate there is no threshold of this type.
    - name: PerfLossLow
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The lower bound of the warning threshold.  A value of 'NaN' is used
          to indicate there is no threshold of this type.
    - name: PerfLossAlarmHigh
      type: boolean
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bound.
          False if the sensor value has not exceeded the defined bound.

          PerfLossAlarmHigh may be set to False to clear an alarm condition.
          The behavior of setting PerfLossAlarmHigh to True is undefined.
    - name: PerfLossAlarmLow
      type: boolean
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bound.
          False if the sensor value has not exceeded the defined bound.

          PerfLossAlarmLow may be set to False to clear an alarm condition.
          The behavior of setting PerfLossAlarmLow to True is undefined.
