      "message": "Everywhere else we have used metric units, so I don\u0027t think we want to start using English units for airflow.  Can we use m^3/s or L/s instead?\n\nL/s actually has a similar scale as CFM.  1 L/S \u003d 2.11888 CFM.\n\nGenerally, other units have already been covered by linux-hwmon as well.  I don\u0027t see airflow covered there yet (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface).  Are we going to be contributing any drivers there?  It would probably be nice to get Guenter\u0027s feedback on appropriate units as well.",
