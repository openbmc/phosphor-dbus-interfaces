    Implementation of BMC state management.  When rebooting we are in
    transition.  When Ready all services required are running
    successfully.  When we are Not Ready this implies not all services have
    started that are required to be.

      values:
          - name: "Ready"
            description: >
                Ready implies all services started and are running successfully

            description: >
                UpdateInProgress implies BMC is in firmware update mode.
                CurrentBMCState will be set to "UpdateInProgress" while starting
                image download and reset to Ready, once activation is done or
                error case during update process.
          - name: "Quiesced"
            description: >
                BMC firmware is quiesced. The BMC firmware is enabled but either
                unresponsive or only processing a restricted set of commands.
                This state may be the result of a service within the BMC going
                into a failed state.
