    Implement to provide memory ECC attributes. The generic
    xyz.openbmc_project.Metrics.Integrity.ErrorStatistics interface is added to
    report the ECC for the different device/module such as Memory, CPU, PCIe,
    Bus... So the xyz.openbmc_project.Memory.MemoryECC interface will be
    deprecated.
