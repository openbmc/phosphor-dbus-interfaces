      "message": "I have a set of patches for 3 repositories (phosphor-dbus-interfaces, phosphor-logging, bmcweb) to implement an rsyslog filter setup through Redfish.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"design\"? If this is a document describing how \"phosphor-rsyslog-conf\" interacts with the user and \"bmcweb\" via DBus, then I don\u0027t have it.\n\nI added a new feature to \"phosphor-rsyslog-conf\" (no changes related to the number of syslog servers supported, i.e. \"phosphor-rsyslog-conf\" still only supports one syslog server).\nAnd the changes in \"bmcweb\" are made in accordance with the Redfish specification.",

It is very surprising to me that we\u0027d want to expose things at this low of a level on dbus/Redfish, but this is where maybe a design would give some insight into the problems being solved.",
