      "message": "Phal application uses as Entity path as common key between Hostboot targetting and device tree,\nConsidering this design direction better to provide Entity path based interface for PHal application and avoid using Physical path based interfaces. physical path is almost arbitrary based on how the mrw gets filled in, packaging can change it and numbering is \"fluid\". entity path is more formalized with meaning so less likely to be weird for different systems.",
