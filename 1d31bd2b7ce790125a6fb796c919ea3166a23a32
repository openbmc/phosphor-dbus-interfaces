      "message": "What if we did something like this instead?  The below greatly simplifies the content of the signal itself that needs sent, and has far fewer ways that a producer of this signal can mess it up.  IMO, it\u0027s also much more obvious, and lets consumers add matches on exactly what they want, rather than having to match on a generic threshold asserted then filter within the application.\n\nsignals:\n    - name: CriticalHighThresholdAsserted\n      description: \u003e\n          One of the alarm properties changed.\n      properties:\n         - name: SensorValue\n           type: double\n           description: \u003e\n               The sensor value that triggered the alarm change.\n    - name: CriticalHighThresholdDeAsserted\n      description: \u003e\n          One of the alarm properties changed.\n      properties:\n         - name: SensorValue\n           type: double\n           description: \u003e\n               The sensor value that triggered the alarm change.\n    - name: CriticalLowThresholdasserted\n      description: \u003e\n          One of the alarm properties changed.\n      properties:\n         - name: SensorValue\n           type: double\n           description: \u003e\n               The sensor value that triggered the alarm change.\n    - name: CriticalLowThresholdDeasserted\n      description: \u003e\n          One of the alarm properties changed.\n      properties:\n         - name: SensorValue\n           type: double\n           description: \u003e\n               The sensor value that triggered the alarm change.",

      "message": "I need to care about 5 thresholds (the new 3 just from virtual-sensor), so that would give me 20 signal handlers as opposed to 1, but I\u0027m OK with it if that\u0027s what can merge.\n\nIt would be nice if someone would agree to make the corresponding change in phoshor-sel-logger (since I can\u0027t do the work) to change to using 8 matches for warning/critical so that dbus-sensors can change so I can get signals from it, which I will need to do (though that isn\u0027t quite as urgent).",
