    Information to enable a daemon to probe hardware based on gpio values
properties:
    - name: Name
      type: string
      description: >
          Used by entity-manager to identify which hw was detected. For internal
          use by entity-manager. Fictional examples are
          'com.meta.Hardware.Yv4.cable0', 'com.meta.Hardware.Yv4.Fanboard0',
          'com.vendorX.Hardware.BoardY.LeakDetector3'. The name should be
          namespaced with dots to avoid collision, according to documented
          Hardware enumerations like
          https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/6a8507d06e172d8d29c0459f0a0d078553d2ecc7/yaml/com/meta/Hardware/BMC.interface.yaml

          Names of the gpio lines.
    - name: PresenceGPIOPolarities
      type: array[uint64]
      description: >
          Polarities of the gpio lines. Active high is equivalent to '1' value.
          Active low is equivalent to '0' value. Choosing 'uint64' instead of
          'bool' here for compatibility with how EM exposes configuration on
          dbus.
