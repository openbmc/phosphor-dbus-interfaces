    Implement to provide CSR and client certificate file descriptors
    and get host acknowledgement status.
    Object which implements this interface should implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete to allow the deletion of
    individual CSR objects.
    Objects will implement this interface on dbus service 'com.ibm.HypervisorCertficate'
    and object path will be  '/com/ibm/HypervisorCertificate/entry/<id>'
    Refer design doc:
