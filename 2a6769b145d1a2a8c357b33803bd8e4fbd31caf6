      "message": "Doesn\u0027t look like anyone is currently writing this one, but I think there might be some pending code to do so.  For similar reasons to the ones writing to the Host state.\n\nFor the multi-host systems we have \"Chassis0\" represent the whole box (with no Host0) and I think we need to force it to show \"on\" somehow when the BMC comes up (because it is on).  Maybe there is some way to do that with discover-state?",
