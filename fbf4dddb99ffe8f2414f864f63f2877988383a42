      "message": "I can’t tell if these interfaces are intended to be free-standing items, which are inserted into a path hierarchy, or they really should be decorators.  This “embedded” one especially doesn’t seem like a free-standing item.\n\nThe three interfaces you’ve defined here are all connector types?  Should we create a connector subdirectory?\n\nI dislike the name of this interface without additional context.  I understand if you’re trying to match Redfish, but as a casual investigator if I were to come across a file ‘Item.Embedded’ I’d really have no idea what it means.  I think we should strive to provide better context on this one.",

      "message": "These interfaces should be decorators that should only be used to determine the connection types. Maybe adding to Decorator folder is better? \n\nI put it here because `Connector` and `PCIESlot` are also an item here... which is also supported as a type. Maybe create a new Connector/Slot interface under Decorator.\n\n\nAnother approach that I am taking is having a property in LocationCode instead like\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/43796/1\n\nYeah, looking at `Item.Embedded` doesn\u0027t make much sense. Maybe `Item.Connector.Embedded` is better.\n\nRedfish supports, Slot, Bay, Connector, Socket, and soon Embedded\n\nMaybe we can have \n\nItem.Connector\n  |_Item.Connector.Bay\n  |_Item.Connector.Connector\n  |_Item.Connector.Socket\n  |_Item.Connector.Slot\n  |_Item.Connector.Embedded",
