      "message": "I think it might be a bit too broad. We wouldn\u0027t want a Cable or PowerSupply to contain a Chassis for instance - those will have more specific relationships (e.g. connecting_to, powering).\n\nOtherwise, if we\u0027re using the same Association for everything, then we should make the name more generic: [having_parent, parent_of] or something like that. I think that\u0027d be too confusing though",
