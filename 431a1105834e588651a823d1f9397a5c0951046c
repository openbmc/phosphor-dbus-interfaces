      "message": "Looks like the PCIe slot interface just contains properties of the card/system the slot is on, and the pcieDevice contains properties of the plugged hardware.\n\nSo to be filled in, they\u0027d have to be reported via two different sources.  If for example, entity-manager was used to hold the properties previously on pcie slot, it doesn\u0027t support writeable properties so there is no way to fill in the pcieDevice ones.\n\nI know we\u0027re using PIM for now so that isn\u0027t an issue for IBM, but it will be eventually.\n\nHow is that peci-pcie app going to fill in the slot properties?",
