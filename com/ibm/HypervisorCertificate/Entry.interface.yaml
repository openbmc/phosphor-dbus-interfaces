    Implement to provide CSR and client certificate file descriptors
    and get host acknowlegement status.
    Object which implements this interface should implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete to allow the deletion of
    individual CSR objects.
    This interface 'com.ibm.HypervisorCertficate' implemented on '/com/ibm/HypervisorCertificate'
    Refer design doc:
     https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/docs/+/23420/26/designs/management-console/VMI_Certificate_Exchange.md
properties:
    - name: csrfd
      type: unixfd
      description: >
          A file descriptor for a file that contains the CSR
          This is a read fd where user read CSR by this fd.
          User should open this fd in read-only mode.
          Size will be passed to host interface as part of request.
          User can evaluate size in case if it does not get as part
          of request.
    - name: certfd
      type: unixfd
      description: >
          A file descriptor for a file to write client certificate
          This is a write fd where caller writes client certificate
          by this fd.User can write whole data at once or can write
          in chunks of bytes and need to close file as soon as writing
          of data completes.User can fail CSR request if write on fd fails.
