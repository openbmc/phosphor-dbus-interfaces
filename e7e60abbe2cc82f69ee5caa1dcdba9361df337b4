I don\u0027t know of any use of this in Redfish (but maybe I\u0027m missing it) so how is internal code going to leverage this for better decision making?",

Many of the dbus-sensors have a \"scale\" factor or some simple calculation they do to clean up the hardware results.  Does this make it \"sythesized\"?",
