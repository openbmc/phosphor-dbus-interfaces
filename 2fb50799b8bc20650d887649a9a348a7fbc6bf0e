      "message": "This can be really confusing to have two events. If really needed I would prefer just one which actually indicates a \"reset\". \n\nhttps://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP2065_2025.3.pdf has PlatformReset but unfortunately, it just has one arg `string: The type of reset that occurred.` -- no mention of what.\n\n@paligill@gmail.com I noticed that all the Platform 1.3.1 message registry spec just assumes there is a \"computer system\" and does not really support multi-host systems or have the message registry provide the resource name/path etc.",
