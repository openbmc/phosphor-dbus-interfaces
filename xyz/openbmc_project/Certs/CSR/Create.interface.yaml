             Valid Key usage extensions and its usage description.

             ClientAuthentication: The public key is used for TLS WWW client
                                   authentication.
             CodeSigning: The public key is used for the signing of executable code.
             CRLSigning: The public key is used for verifying signatures on
                         certificate revocation lists (CLRs).
             DataEncipherment: The public key is used for directly enciphering
                               raw user data without the use of an intermediate
                               symmetric cipher.
             DecipherOnly: The public key could be used for deciphering data
                           while performing key agreement.
             DigitalSignature: The public key is used for verifying digital
                               signatures, other than signatures on certificates
                               and CRLs.
             EmailProtection: The public key is used for email protection.
             EncipherOnly: The public key could be used for enciphering data
                           while performing key agreement.

                          public key certificates.
             KeyEncipherment: The public key is used for enciphering private or
                              secret keys.
             NonRepudiation: The public key is used to verify digital signatures,
                             other than signatures on certificates and CRLs,
                             and used to provide a non- repudiation service that
                             protects against the signing entity falsely denying
                             some action.
