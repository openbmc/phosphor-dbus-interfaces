    Implement this to add system dump management.

    System dumps are dump of the host memory and hardware states generated
    during a failure in the host firmware. This can be a huge dump stored in the
    host memory, the BMC doesnt store this dump but stream this dump to an
    external client based on the offload request. Apart from system generated
    system dump, users can also request for this kind of dump.

properties:
    - name: SourceDumpId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          The dump id provided by the source of the dump. There are dumps which
          get generated outside the BMC, like a system dump which gets generated
          and stored in the host memory. All dumps will have a  unique id  but
          when communicating to the source of the dump the SourceDumpId will be
          used.
