    Implement to represent properties related to
    SPDM Measurements set.

methods:
    - name: SPDMGetSignedMeasurements
      description: >
          This method generates an SPDM cryptographic signed statement over
          the given nonce and measurements of the SPDM Responder.

      parameters:
          - name: MeasurementIndices
            type: array[uint32]
            description: >
                An array of indices that identify the measurement blocks to
                sign.

          - name: Nonce
            type: string
            description: >
                A 32-byte hex-encoded string that is signed with the
                measurements. The value should be unique.

          - name: SlotId
            type: uint32
            description: >
                The slot identifier for the certificate containing the private
                key to generate the signature over the measurements.

      returns:
          - name: MeasurementResponse
            type: struct[object_path, string, string, string, string, string]
            description: >
                The response will contain a struct with following fields:
                Certificate, HashingAlgorithm, PublicKey, SignedMeasurements,
                SignedAlgorithm, Version.

                Among them, Certificate refers to certificate object
                corresponding to the SPDM slot identifier that can be used
                to validate the signature.
