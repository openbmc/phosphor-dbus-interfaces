      "message": "It seems like we\u0027ve deviated from the meaning of \u0027Quiesced\u0027 in the System (or Chassis?), which is unfortunate.  In System it means \"on but doing nothing\", here it means \"on but doing nothing useful\".\n\n\"The host firmware is enabled... can be a result of the host entering an error state\" \u003c-- these seem contradictory.  Is there an \u0027or\u0027 missing somewhere in here?  Should this become a list.\n\n\"enabled but only processing\" \u003c-- should this be \"but _may be_ only\"?  Is there any case where it could be processing all commands, whatever that means?  Is there any case where it could be processing no commands?  What does \"processing commands\" even mean; from who\u0027s perspective is it?\n\nDo we need any language to indicate that no data loss can be expected from turning off in this state?  This seems kind of like the \"It is now safe to turn off your computer\" screen state in Windows 95.",

      "message": "We were pretty short and vague in our initial definitions of PDI. That resulted in the implementations of the interfaces having a bit more leeway. I\u0027m wondering if I should have just left this as-is and allowed the implementation and it\u0027s use by external API\u0027s like Redfish to be where clarity is found? Let me see if I can find a good combo here. It definitely does need an \"or\".\n\nProcessing commands from a system perspective means the ability to start an operating system or request a graceful shutdown. From a hypervisor perspective it means the ability of it to process certain PLDM commands.\n\nWhen the system quiesces, that could be a sign of an unexpected error, so no guarantees on data integrity. But, powering off from this state will not make it any worse so I think I\u0027ll just leave out any mention.",
