      "message": "The expectation of this commit is Fabric Adapter can be connected to multiple PCIeSlots. As this is new association with required endpoint interface of PCIe slot, created new association name spanning to make it unique.\nAlso fabric adapters are connected to ports as well as slots, using same association ports and slots will be confusing.",

      "message": "\"confusing\" in what way?  I explicitly wanted to avoid a huge set of associations and especially ones that encode the type in them.  It seems like you\u0027re just working around that direction and coming up with a different association.\n\nLooking at the other associations we\u0027ve used, I think that the FabricAdapter would be `contained_by` the PCIeSlot?  That is what we\u0027ve tried to use else where for containment association to show the device present in the slot.  Does that work for this situation?",
