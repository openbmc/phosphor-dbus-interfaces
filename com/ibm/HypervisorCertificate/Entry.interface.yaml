    Implement to get CSR string signed by host and get
    client certificate.
    Object which implements this interface should implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete to allow the deletion of
    individual CSR objects.
    Objects will implement this interface on dbus service 'com.ibm.HypervisorCertficate'
    and object path will be  '/com/ibm/HypervisorCertificate/entry/<id>'
    Refer design doc:

          It's a read-only property.

          Client certificate content.
          Host interface looks for 'InterfaceAdded' signal of the object.
          and forwards CSR to host to get signed client certificate.
          Host interface sets this property with client certificate recieved
          from host.
          User reads this property based on HostAck status.
