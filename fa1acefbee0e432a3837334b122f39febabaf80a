Are there any attributes associated with them?  If there aren\u0027t any attributes anyhow, I think it is simpler to just keep them in open_power, otherwise we need to discuss with Intel, AMD, Arm and understand if it also matches their hardware design and that will just slow you down.\n\nI\u0027ve previously worked on P5 thru P9 and none of these chiplets existed for any of those chips except the \u0027MC\u0027 and \u0027PHB\u0027 (and arguably what the \u0027MC\u0027 contained has changed on every processor generation since P5).  I\u0027d still recommend putting these into a subdirectory.  Maybe \"Item.Chiplet.Power10.xxx\", but ultimately that is up to your team to decide.",
