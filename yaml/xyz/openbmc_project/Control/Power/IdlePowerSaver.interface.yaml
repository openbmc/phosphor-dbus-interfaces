    Implement Idle Power Saver capabilities of the system.

properties:
    - name: Enabled
      type: boolean
      description: >
          This property shall indicate whether idle power save is enabled.

    - name: EnterUtilizationPercent
      type: byte
      description: >
          This property shall indicate the percentage of utilization that the
          computer system shall be lower than to enter idle power save.

    - name: EnterDwellTime
      type: uint64
      description: >
          This property shall indicate the duration in milliseconds the computer
          system is below the EnterUtilizationPercent value before the idle
          power saver is activated.

    - name: ExitUtilizationPercent
      type: byte
      description: >
          This property shall indicate the percentage of utilization that the
          computer system shall be above than to exit idle power save.

      description: >
          This property shall indicate the duration in milliseconds the computer
          system is above the ExitUtilizationPercent value before the idle power

          - readonly
      description: >
          This property shall indicate whether idle power save is currently
          active on the system. When this is true, the system has reduced power
          to save energy.
