      "message": "I think we need some discussion on why this is different from telemetry and why we should go this direction.\n\nI\u0027m a little concerned in a few aspects:\n\n1. We already have telemetry, which is hardly used.\n2. There seems to only be one design that is going to take advantage of this, which hasn\u0027t reached consensus yet.  I don\u0027t know how this is going to be used by Redfish since it is not a \"normal\" sensor.\n3. We already had a poor situation with thresholds where we ended up having to create N optional separate interfaces to track them, and we solved this differently with metric thresholds (to reduce the sprawl of optional interfaces).  We might want to go that route here also?\n\n(Regarding #3, the hope is that someone refactors sensor thresholds to use the metric threshold design at some point also.)",
