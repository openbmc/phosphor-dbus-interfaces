    Implement this to pass additional parameters to the create dump. Each
    required parameter for the dump in the ibm domain should be added here as an
    enum.

enumerations:
    - name: CreateParameters
      description: >
          Additional parameters for creating the dump.
      values:
          - name: "VSPString"
            description: >
                The resource dump is collected from various host resources. The
                resource to collect the dump is indicated by using the resource
                selector. The resource selector string needs to be passed to
                host to generate a resource dump.
          - name: "Password"
            description: >
                The password for authenticating the resource dump request.
          - name: "ErrorLogId"
            description: >
                The id of the log associated with action which triggered the
                dump. The value should be a 32 bit unsigned integer.
          - name: "DumpType"
            description: >
                Type of the dump to be collected
          - name: "FailingUnitId"
            description: >
                A unique id of failing hardware unit which is causing the dump.
                The value should be a 32 bit unsigned integer.
          - name: "ACFPath"
            description: >
                The absolute path to a targeted Access Control File (ACF)
                used to trigger a specific host operation like resource
                dump. The file is parsed by the BMC and sent to the host
                via PLDM.

    - name: DumpType
      description: >
          Type of the host dump to be collected.
      values:
          - name: "Hostboot"
            description: >
                Hostboot dump is collected during a boot failure during the
