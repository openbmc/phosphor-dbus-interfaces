    Implement to fetch the StateEffecterPDR's. This  API would 
    be used by PLDM Requester apps (other than pldm daemon) to
    access the primary PDR repo.

    A OpenBMC implementation must provide implementation of
    xyz.openbmc_project.PLDM.PDR on /xyz/openbmc_project/pldm.

        - name: TID
          type: byte
