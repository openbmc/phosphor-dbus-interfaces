            For error events, this is the failing subsystem. We can have many
            sunbsystems in a system.            
            Some examples of Possible subsystems
                - Processor Subsystem
                - Processor FRU
                - Processor Chip Cache
                - Processor Unit (CPU)
                - Processor Bus Controller
                - Memory Subsystem
                - Memory Controller
                - Memory Bus Interface
                - Memory DIMM
                - Memory Card/FRU
                - I/O Storage Subsystem
