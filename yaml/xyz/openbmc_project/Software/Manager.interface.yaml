    Implement this interface for clients to identify the code update manager
    which will process the multi part image and orchestrate with code updaters
    for the code update process. This is an optional interface to be implemented
    if the client needs to delegate the code update process to the code update
    manager for multi part images. The implementer also needs to implement the
    xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Update interface for the client to pass the
    multi part image and update parameters.

properties:
    - name: Targets
      type: array[object_path]

          An array of D-Bus object paths that are in the
          /xyz/openbmc_project/software/ namespace that indicate the code update
          targets to be updated. The targets for code update will be the
          intersection of the Targets property and the software the multi part
          image will update. If the Targets property is empty, all the software
          in the multi part image will be updated. Targets should be cleared by
          the client before StartUpdate if it not applicable for the multi part
          image.
