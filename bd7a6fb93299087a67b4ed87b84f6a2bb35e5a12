The intent is to have two generic services based on severity level which can accept parameterized detector name (https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/75329/31/src/leakdetector/LeakDetector.cpp#18).\nThis change was made in response to @Patrick\u0027s comment \"Why do we have static targets here? Don\u0027t we need them to have some kind of position identifier?\"\nfrom https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/75329/comment/34150a60_aa2379d9/",
