description: >
    Implement to provide performance loss class sensor thresholds.  Objects
    implementing Sensor.Threshold.NonRecoverable must be instantiated in the
    correct hierarchy within the sensors namespace.  The following sensor
    hierarchies are recognized:
      airflow
      altitude
      current
      energy
      fan_tach
      humidity
      power
      pressure
      temperature
      utilization
      voltage

    Additionally, any object implementing Sensor.Threshold.NonRecoverable must
    also implement Sensor.Value.

properties:
    - name: NonRecoverableHigh
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The upper bound of the warning threshold.  A value of 'NaN' is used to
          indicate there is no threshold of this type.
    - name: NonRecoverableLow
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The lower bound of the warning threshold.  A value of 'NaN' is used to
          indicate there is no threshold of this type.
    - name: NonRecoverableAlarmHigh
      type: boolean
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bound. False if the
          sensor value has not exceeded the defined bound.

          NonRecoverableAlarmHigh may be set to False to clear an alarm
          condition. The behavior of setting NonRecoverableAlarmHigh to True is
          undefined.
    - name: NonRecoverableAlarmLow
      type: boolean
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bound. False if the
          sensor value has not exceeded the defined bound.

          NonRecoverableAlarmLow may be set to False to clear an alarm
          condition. The behavior of setting NonRecoverableAlarmLow to True is
          undefined.
