Shouldn\u0027t it be created *by* the ItemUpdater?\n\nIt isn\u0027t the software version that is potentially write-protected, but the flash location where the software version is intended to be written.  Doesn\u0027t only the ItemUpdater know this?\n\nFor example, consider the BMC with two static-layout flash banks where NOR-0 is locked with a write-protect resistor.  Both flash banks could contain version v123.  It isn\u0027t v123 that is write-protected but NOR-0.  If you upload v124, how does the *ImageManager* know that v124 is not write-protected?  Only the *ItemUpdater* can know this.",
