    Implement this to add SBE dump management.

    Self Boot Engine(SBE) is a microcontroller that sits inside the processor to
    initialize it to start the booting and also acts as a secure channel for
    accessing certain control functions on the processor. During the booting or
    other hardware access operations SBE can encounter errors and become
    unresponsive. In such situations, the debug data needs to be collected from
    such SBEs to find out the root cause of the error. This data includes
    hardware state, configuration, memory, etc. The collected data is then
    packaged into the OpenPOWER dump format and which is called as SBE dump.
    There will be one instance of SBE on each processor. Implement this
    interface to add support for managing the SBE dump.

properties:
    - name: ErrorLogId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          The id of the log associated with the action which triggered the dump.
          This ID is a reference to an error log entry in the logging system.
          The value should be a 32-bit unsigned integer.

    - name: FailingUnitId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          A unique id of the failing SBE which is causing the dump. This ID
          could be used to identify the specific SBE  within the system. The
          value should be a 32-bit unsigned integer.
