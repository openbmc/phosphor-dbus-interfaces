          - name: Module
            description: >
                A small, typically removable, chassis or card that contains
                devices for a particular subsystem or function.

          - name: Zone
            description: >
                A logical division or portion of a physical chassis that

associations:
    - name: powered_by
      description: >
          Objects that implement Chassis can optionally implement the
          'powered_by' association to provide a link to one or more power
          supplies.

      description: >
          Objects that implement Chassis can optionally implement the
          'total_power' association to provide a link to a single sensor to
          provide the total power consumption of the chassis.
