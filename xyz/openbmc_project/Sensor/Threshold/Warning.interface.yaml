    Implement to provide warning class sensor thresholds.  Objects implementing
    Sensor.Threshold.Warning must be instantiated in the correct hierarchy within
    the sensors namespace.  The following sensor hierarchies are recognized:
      temperature
      fan_tach
      voltage
      altitude

    Additionally, any object implementing Sensor.Threshold.Warning must also
    implement Sensor.Value.

properties:
    - name: WarningHigh
      type: int64
      description: >
          The upper bound of the warning threshold.
    - name: WarningLow
      type: int64
      description: >
          The lower bound of the warning threshold.
    - name: WarningAlarm
      type: boolean
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bounds.
          False if the sensor value has not exceeded the defined bounds.

          WarningAlarm may be set to False to clear an alarm condition.
          The behavior of setting WarningAlarm to True is undefined.
