      "message": "\u003e Nothing else in the PID control pipeline has units. Units are a matter of human interpretation, and associated with individual sensors.\n\nI think this is the point of difference. Doesn\u0027t the PID loop operate over individual sensors? And don\u0027t those sensors expose their unit? Isn\u0027t any derived value in terms of that unit? Doesn\u0027t that give these values their associated unit?\n\nAs it stands I think this interface is attempting to be too abstract. It feels a bit like `std::pair` in C++ - yes, there are lots of pairs of things, but the useful bit isn\u0027t abstracting over the entire concept, it\u0027s naming the relationships between the things that are paired. Writing code accessing `.first` and `.second` doesn\u0027t do anything to clarify that relationship for the reader, especially when often the type information is elided in the source by iterators and `auto`. It feels the same way here. That fan and thermal PID loops happen to have the same shape and can be made to fit in the same interface doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s easy to comprehend the intent, especially when other information like the object path can be obscured by the code. It feels easy for the result to be confusing, and for that confusion to become bugs.\n\nTaking a different tack: Can these sensor properties instead be associations back to underlying sensors rather than proxying the instance and value? What are the concerns generated by that approach?\n\nA third tack is having separate interfaces for thermal and fan zones. That way we can at least make some assertions about the values having a consistent unit even if the unit cannot be known from the interface itself: We can at least separate out fan from thermal zones in a mapper query.",

If units are desired, the user can use the provided information here to cross-reference back, and eventually iterate back to the individual sensors, and get the units information from there.

I believe a read-only \"Name\" string field would help find the individual PID loop of interest. This would map back to the name of the PID loop, as the user configured it in the JSON file to entity-manager originally (or hardcoded in the old config.json file for phosphor-pid-control).\n\nAs for having the same interface for Power and Fan loops, they really are the same thing. Duplicating interfaces seems too complex and duplicative. Perhaps a read-only \"Type\" or \"Class\" field would help the user distinguish.

Duplicating interfaces seems too complex and duplicative.\n\nBut the different PID loop instantiations operate on different input data. That\u0027s my point of contention here. The PID algorithm might not care what the values are and generalises over them, but the _integrator_ (person) of the PID loop _definitely_ cares about the meaning of the inputs and outputs it generates in the context of the system(s) its driving. That is the problem I\u0027m trying to highlight. Programmatically consuming the information exposed by this interface requires context for the values. I\u0027m concerned that by skipping the context we\u0027re defining a DBus interface that is difficult to exploit.\n\n\u003e Perhaps a read-only \"Type\" or \"Class\" field would help the user distinguish.

They are necessarily a DBus type, albeit a container type rather than a basic type.
