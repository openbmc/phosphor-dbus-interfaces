      "message": "Is there a way the DUID changes can be exposed with a higher level API?\nThe phosphor-network daemon should be the only entity with detailed knowledge of the DUID configuration.\n\nI bring this up because I am experiencing some pain caused by exposing systemd.network details. This in turn forced D-Bus supplicants to have to duplicate logic that belongs solely to phosphor-network.",

      "message": "The ClientIdentifier is currently set to mac by the default network file. As per https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html we can enable a system to use duid and other values for ClientIdentifier \n\nThere is no command given to the user to set the ClientIdentifier while enabling the dynamic network. So this change is intended to be used by the system vendor to set the ClientIdentifier to desired value before the box is shipped. I dont think ClientIdentifier should be exposed to any user. This is a personal information of the BMC.\n\nJohnathan - are you saying that this need not be a dbus attribute, instead vendor can directly edit the network files ? I am intending to enable the vendor to use busctl commands in a script to set desired values to dbus, and that can set the network files instead of manually editing the network files. But yes, different feedbacks on this are welcome.",
