description: >
    Implement this interface to provide report inspection features. An
    implementation service should additionally implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete for deletion of individual report objects.

methods:
  - name: Update
    description: >
        The Update method is defined for the on demand metric report update.
        It triggers update of the Readings property. If ReportingType is not
        set to OnRequest then method does nothing.

properties:
  - name: Persistency
    type: enum[self.Persistency]
    description: >
        Defines how the report shall be stored.
  - name: ReadingParameters
    type: array[struct[array[path],enum[self.OperationType],string,string]]
    description: >
        Array of structure that contains list of sensor DBus paths, operation
        type, metric Id and metadata that is used to map DBus paths to Redfish
        URIs. Redfish URIs are divided by commas.
  - name: Readings
    type: array[struct[string,string,double,uint64]]
    description: >
        Array of structure that contains metric Id, metadata, reading value and
        timestamp of reading. Metric Id and metadata are equal to its
        counterparts in ReadingParameters property.
    flags:
    - readonly
  - name: ReportActions
    type: array[enum[self.ReportAction]]
    description: Defines action that is taken on readings update.
    flags:
    - const
  - name: ReportingType
    type: enum[self.ReportingType]
    description: Defines how readings are updated.
  - name: ScanPeriod
    type: uint64
    description: >
        Defines period of time in milliseconds when readings are updated.
  - name: Timestamp
    type: uint64
    description: Defines when readings were updated in milliseconds
    flags:
    - readonly

signals:
  - name: ReportUpdate
    description: >
        Emits when readings are updated and only when Event is set in
        ReportActions property. The purpose of this signal is to integrate
        Report with the Redfish Event Service.
