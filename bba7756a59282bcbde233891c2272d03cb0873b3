I can revise the section like below.\n\n\"Object paths are often namespaced by starting with a reversed domain name.

I\u0027m not so sure networks being optional though. If we\u0027re representing MCTP endpoints (ie, something that has an EID), then the endpoint has to be on one (and only one) network. That network may well be the \u0027default\u0027, for cases where the system only has one network - which will probably be the usual case.\n\nSo I think the fixed structure of /xyz/openbmc_project/mctp/\u003cnetwork\u003e/\u003cendpoint\u003e would work best.",
