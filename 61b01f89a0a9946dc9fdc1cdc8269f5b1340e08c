      "message": "1. We should move this nearby the other memory metrics.\n\n2. Right now the only primary path is \"BMC\" (see line 122), but I think you said these are for \"GPUs\".  We also need some sort of path segment to identify the device(s) these are for.\n\n3. I don\u0027t know what \"capacity utilization\" means.  How is that different from `(available/total)`?  Is there any reason why we\u0027re wanting to represent this as a specific piece of math (to create a percentage) rather than give the real underlying numbers, which are already identified here?",

You\u0027re doing something different than the existing metric design but we\u0027re just suppose to surmise this?  In any case, you still need a way to name the metrics.  That\u0027s what the path segments represent.\n\n\u003e 3. We will conider the #3 that is suggested.\n\nWhat?  This was not a \"suggestion\".  You\u0027re using Nvidia-internal terminology and expecting everyone else to automatically know what it means.  I don\u0027t know what \"capacity utilization\" means; you haven\u0027t even explained that to me let alone making it clear to people later on reading this YAML file.",
