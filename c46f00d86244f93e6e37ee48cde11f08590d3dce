It\u0027s pretty likely we would have a 10mbps port, which wouldn\u0027t be able to be represented by this cleanly.\n\nAlso, using a float here causes some level of division issues if you want to convert to bits/bytes per second, so we should just avoid those.\n\nLets just convert this to a uint64, measured in bits per second.  We can treat 0 as the \"not available\" number.",
