    the  xyz.openbmc_project.Sensors.Value interface on the same object path to
    show valve's open status in percentage units.

properties:
    - name: OpenValve
      type: boolean
      description: >
          The target open status of the valve. If the value is true, the valve
          will be opened. If the value is false, the valve will be closed.

paths:
    - namespace: /xyz/openbmc_project/control
      segments:
          - name: ValveOpen
            value: valve_open
