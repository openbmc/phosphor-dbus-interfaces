      "message": "I have some confusion on this being classified as a \"button\".  It seems like your implementation has a \"position up\" and \"position down\" button which you are turning into a Position property (or maybe you just have \"position up\").\n\nAt a hardware level you could implement a position selector in (at least) 3 ways:\n    - A position up button with an optional position down.\n    - A rotary dial.\n    - A slider with stops from position 0 to N.\n\nI suspect the consumer of this \"button\" should not care which of the 3 hardware implementations the design has, but this interface design you\u0027ve chosen implies the first option.  Please think about how all 3 hardware designs could be modeled from a software perspective and modify this interface to cover.\n\nIt is quite likely that the signals will need to change, maybe to just a single signal like \"position changed\" but then I don\u0027t know why we need another signal beyond the PropertyChanged signal on Position.",
