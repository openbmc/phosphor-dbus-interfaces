    Implement to provide host state management

properties:
    - name: RequestedHostTransition
      type: enum[self.Transition]
      default: 'Off'
      description: >
          The desired host transition.  This will be preserved across AC
          power cycles of the BMC.

    - name: CurrentHostState
      type: enum[self.HostState]
      description: >
          A read-only property describing the current state of the host
          firmware. A user can determine if a system is in transition by
          comparing the CurrentHostState and the RequestedHostTransition
          properties.

enumerations:
    - name: Transition
      description: >
        The desired transition for host firmware
      values:
        - name: 'Off'
          description: >
            Host firmware should be off
        - name: 'On'
          description: >
            Host firmware should be on
        - name: 'Reboot'
          description: >
            Host firmware should be rebooted

    - name: HostState
      description: >
        The current state of the host firmware
      values:
        - name: 'Off'
          description: >
            Host firmware is not running
        - name: 'Running'
          description: >
            Host firmware is running
        - name: 'Quiesced'
          description: >
            Host firmware is quiesced
        - name: 'DiagnosticMode'
          description: >
            Host firmware is capturing debug information. Powering off your
            system while the host is in this state will prevent the debug data
            from being properly collected. The host will move to one of the
            other states once complete.
