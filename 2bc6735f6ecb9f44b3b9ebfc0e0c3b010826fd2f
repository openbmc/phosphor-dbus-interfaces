You have detected a correctable ECC error.\n    - Why doesn\u0027t the reader automatically fix it on its own?  Why do you need a special dbus interface to correct and re-write?\n\n2. You have detected an uncorrectable ECC error.\n    - How are you going to fix it at that point?\n\nI would suggest rethinking this interface entirely and updating the description (and name) with a more accurate description of what this function is expected to do.",
