    Implement this interface for clients to identify the multi part manager
    which will process the multi part image and orchestrate the code update
    process with multiple devices. This is an optional interface to be implemented
    if the client needs to delegate the code update process of a multi part image 
    and no Targets are specified. The implementer also needs to implement the
    xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Update interface for the client to pass the
    multi part image and update parameters.
