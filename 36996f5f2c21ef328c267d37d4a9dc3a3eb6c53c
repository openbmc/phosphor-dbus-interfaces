      "message": "Concept LGTM.\n\nSuggestion: Instead of hardcoding the parameter \"All\" or \"all\" as a value that\u0027s a special case, you could have 2 different API calls. Example, \"SetPwm\" takes a string and a double, and \"SetPwmAll\" takes only a double (and sets all fans in the zone). The advantage is that it avoids establishing special meanings to particular hardcoded zone names, which simplifies interactions elsewhere.\n",
