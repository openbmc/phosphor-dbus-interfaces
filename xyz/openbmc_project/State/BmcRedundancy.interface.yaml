          indicates the active-primary BMC path, looks like:

          An array of forward, reverse, endpoint tuples where:
              forward - The type of the association.
              reverse - The type of the association to create for the endpoint.
              endpoint - The association endpoint. It looks like
              "/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/chassisX/bmcX",
              'X' stands digit number.
