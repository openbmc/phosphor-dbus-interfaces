      "message": "When BMC is connected to different networks, EID is not guaranteed to be unique. So there is a possibility that we will have multiple endpoint objects with same EID (coming from different MCTP Daemon instances). Now, if the upper layers want to talk to a certain EID, then how do they differentiate ?\n\nI think we might need Network ID as a property here.\n-If BMC works in BusOwner mode, generate Network ID\n-If BMC works in EndPoint mode, get the Network ID from the BusOwner. If BusOwner does not respond to Get Network ID control command, then probably should generate it ourselves.",
