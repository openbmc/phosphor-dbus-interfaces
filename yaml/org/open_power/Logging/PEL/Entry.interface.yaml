    Implement to provide PEL event/error entry attributes.
properties:
    - name: Hidden
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: >
          Hidden Error - This flag allows events to be placed in a system, but
          remain hidden from the customer. This event log is visible to
          development personnel only, e.g. hardware recovered error, etc. No
          service action is required for this type of errors. In general, when
          this value is used, the Error Action Flags has the value of "Hidden
          Error". An event log with this value is used primarily for error
          thresholding design/code debug or as a record to indicate an error
          frequency or trend.
    - name: Subsystem
      type: string
      description: >
          A free form, implementation defined string which uniquely and
          permanently identifies a specific subsystem string. This field should
          not be used for programmatic interrogation of an object.
    - name: ManagementSystemAck
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: >
          Notifies the PEL handler that the management system acknowledged a
          PEL. The management system can be any system monitoring the hardware.
    - name: PlatformLogID
      type: uint32
      description: >
          This is the Platform Log ID field in the Private Header section of a
          PEL.  It is the unique ID for a single event.  Multiple PELs can be
          linked to the same event by using the same PLID value.
    - name: Deconfig
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: >
          Indicates that one or more resources were deconfigured due to this
          error.
    - name: Guard
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: >
          Indicates that one or more resources were guarded due to this error.
    - name: Timestamp
      type: uint64
      description: >
          The creation timestamp of the PEL in milliseconds since the epoch. For
          PELs created by subsystems other than the BMC, this can be different
          than the timestamp property on the xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry
          interface.
