    This interface contains a Create method, which can be implemented
    to allow creation of xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry objects
    directly over D-Bus, without needing the errors defined in
    the *.Error/metadata.yaml files.  It also provides a parameter
    for passing data through to extensions.

methods:
    - name: Create
      description: >
          Create a xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry object.
      parameters:
        - name: Message
          type: string
          description: >
            The Message property of the event entry.
        - name: Severity
          type: enum[xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry.Level]
          description: >
            The Severity property of the event entry.  These values
            match the ones defined in xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry.
        - name: AdditionalData
          type: dict[string, string]
          description: >
            The AdditionalData property of the event entry.
            e.g.:
              {
                "key1": "value1",
                "key2": "value2"
              }
            ends up in AdditionaData like:
              ["KEY1=value1", "KEY2=value2"]
        - name: ExtensionParameterJSON
          type: string
          description: >
              A JSON string that can contain parameters for any
              logging extensions.  Extensions will be tolerant of
              of entries in the JSON not meant for them, and will
              also allow an empty string as there are other APIs
              to create a log that won't have this data anyway.
