      "message": "Can an interface be changed retroactively? I was earlier told that it could not be, that there was a general OpenBMC rule in which an interface, once significantly used, had to remain the same forever, and we had to create a new interface if we wanted to add another field to it. I remember running into this with the trivial addition of \"Mutable\" in the Sensor Value interface, which I thought no big deal, but to my surprise ended up being unacceptable, and a whole another interface had to be made just to hold that bool. Is this still the case?",
