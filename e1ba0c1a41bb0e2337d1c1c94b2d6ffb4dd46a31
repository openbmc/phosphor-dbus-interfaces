      "message": "We need some better language in description then to make a clear delineation.  We used the word \"ID\" in both of them for two different purposes.\n\nIf I were implementing this dbus object, how would I know what is suppose to be in EventId?  (And I need you to clarify this in the commit because frankly, I have no idea what you\u0027re intending to go here.)\n\nSince our Entries are currently created from metadata that is in this repository, connected to phosphor-logging, how does this affect phosphor-logging and the metadata in this repository? \n\nWouldn\u0027t a sha256(Message) be a \"Unique Identifier for the Event\"?",
