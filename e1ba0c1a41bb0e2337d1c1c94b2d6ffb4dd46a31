      "message": "I haven\u0027t seen why Redfish says they created this property, but I would think it is either to a) allow an implementer to use their own IDs so that they can match up with their documentation, or b) allow a way to distinguish events with the same Message.  We\u0027re going to use it for both.\n\nWe\u0027re going to put a PEL SRC into the EventID, which is a way to uniquely identify the meaning of the event.  For example, the \u0027id\u0027 could be \u00271\u0027, the \u0027Message\u0027 would be \u0027xyz.openbmc_project.Host.Error.Event\u0027, and the \u0027EventId\u0027 would be \u0027BC803001\u0027.  Another host error would have the same Message, but a different EventId if  the error meant something else.  To me, this is the exact definition of what EventID is to be used for.",
