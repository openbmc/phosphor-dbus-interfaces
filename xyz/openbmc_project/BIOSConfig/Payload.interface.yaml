    Remote BIOS Config manager daemon will create payload objects
    for every payload received in the system under
    object path /xyz/openbmc_project/biosconfigMgr/<PayloadType>.
    Each payload object can be handled through 'org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager'.
    PayloadType object will expose following properties and methods.
    xyz.openbmc_project.BIOSConfig.Payload interface.
    This interface is used to access and validate the payload / file.

properties:

        - name: Status
          type: enum[self.PayloadStatus]
          description: >
            This contain current payload status.
