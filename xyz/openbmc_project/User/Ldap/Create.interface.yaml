    Implement to create LDAP name service daemon configuration file.

methods:
    - name: CreateConfig
      description: >
          This method always creates a new config file as well as a D-Bus 
          object to represent the config, it will destroy an existing one,
          if found. In other words, this is not an update API. Individual
          properties can be updated as per the
          xyz/openbmc_project/User/Ldap/Config.interface.yaml.
      parameters:
        - name: LDAPServerURI
          type: string
          description: >

        - name: LDAPBindDN
          type: string
          description: >
              Specifies the distinguished name with which to bind to the
              directory server for lookups.
        - name: LDAPBaseDN
          type: string
          description: >

          description: >

        - name: LDAPSearchScope
          type: enum[self.SearchScope]
          description: >

          description: >

              to react differently for AD vs openldap.
