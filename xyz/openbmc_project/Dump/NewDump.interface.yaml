    This interface provides methods to add new dump either a dump existing
    somehere else and ready to be offloaded or a new dump to be created on
    the BMC.

    Any OpenBMC implementation must provide exactly one implementation of
    xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.NewDump on /xyz/openbmc_project/dump.

methods:
    - name: Notify
      description: >
         Use this method when the dump is already created and ready
         to be offloaded. This method will add a new dump object with the
         properties provided. The create method should be used when the
         data needs to be collected and packaged.
      parameters:
       - name: DumpType
         type: enum[self.DumpType]
         description: >
            Type of the dump
       - name: SourceDumpId
         type: uint32
         description: >
             The dump id provided by the source of the dump.
             There are dumps which get generated outside the BMC, like a
             system dump which gets generated and stored in the host memory.
             All dumps will have a  unique id  but when communicating
             to the source of the dump the SourceDumpId will be used.
       - name: Size
         type: uint64

            Size of the dump in bytes
      errors:
        - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InternalFailure
        - xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Create.Error.Disabled

    - name: CreateDump
      description: >
         Initiate the creation of a new dump based on the parameters.
      parameters:
       - name: DumpType
         type: enum[self.DumpType]
         description: >
            Type of the dump
       - name: ErrorLogId
         type: uint32
         description: >
             The unique id of the error log, which initiated the
             dump. This information is needed to correlate the
             dump to the error or even log. This can be 0 for the
             dumps initiated by the user.
      returns:
       - name: Id
         type: uint32
         description: >
             The Dump entry id number.
      errors:
        - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InternalFailure
        - xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.Create.Error.Disabled
