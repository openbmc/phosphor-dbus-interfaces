    Implement to show the states of the first PID control loop(thermal/power).

properties:
    - name: Leader
      type: string
      flags:
          - readonly

          This means the name of the thermal sensor that is the highest temp in
          input sensor list.

    - name: ClassType
      type: string
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The class of this PID loop. It can be "Temperature", "Margin", "Power"
          or "PowerSum".

    - name: Setpoint
      type: double
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          This pid config's setpoint.

    - name: Input
      type: double
      flags:
          - readonly

          The "Leader" sensor reading.

          This property is the thermal PID loop result. This data doesn't have
          static unit, it can be RPM or PWM depending on PID parameter settings.
