    Interface to initiate a Lamp Test request.
    Lamp Test is a method of testing the functionality of all the
    software controlled LEDs in the system. How this is achieved
    is left to implementations.

    One possible implementation might be to turn ON all applicable LEDs
    for a certain period of time along with available LCD displays and also
    the LEDs on the external drawers that are connected via PCIE.
    This enables a visual inspection of all the LEDs and LCDs for their
    correctness.

    If the user initiates the lamp test while one is already in progress,
    then the test continues for the new configured time.
    Lamp test can also be initiated from the Operator Panel hardware.

    If the state of a particular LED has to be changed during the test, then
    the implementation might chose to honour the request but not act on physical
    LED until the test is finished. However, this restriction does not apply to
    LCD displays.

          Since Lamp test is a long running request, need an associated
          D-Bus path so the clients can monitor
