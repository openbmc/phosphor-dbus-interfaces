    Implement to provide triggers management.

methods:
  - name: AddTrigger
    description:
        Create new object that represent Trigger with
        xyz.openbmc_project.Telemetry.Trigger interface stored in path
        /xyz/openbmc_project/Telemetry/Triggers/{Domain}/{Name} where
        Domain and Name are parameters of this method.
    parameters:
      - name: name
        type: string
        description: >
            Defines the name of report to be exposed over D-Bus. Service allows
            to use separator '/' in name to group reports in directory.
      - name: triggerActions
        type: array[enum[xyz.openbmc_project.Telemetry.Trigger.TriggerAction]]
        description: >
            Defines which actions are taken when threshold conditions are met.
      - name: sensors
        type: array[struct[object_path,string]]
        description: >
            Array of sensors that is monitored within trigger. Object path
            points to a sensor in DBus envrionment. String is used as user
            metadata.
      - name: reportNames
        type: array[string]
        description: >
            Collection of report names that are updated when threshold
            conditions are met. This parameter is ignored if triggerActions
            parameter does not contain 'UpdateReport' action.
      - name: thresholds
        type: variant[array[struct[enum[xyz.openbmc_project.Telemetry.Trigger.Type],uint64,enum[xyz.openbmc_project.Telemetry.Trigger.Direction],double]],array[struct[string,enum[xyz.openbmc_project.Telemetry.Trigger.Severity],uint64,string]]]
        description: >
            Contains array of numeric or discrete thresholds that are described
            in xyz.openbmc_project.Telemetry.Trigger interface.
    returns:
      - name: triggerPath
        type: object_path
        description: >
            Path to new trigger ->
            /xyz/openbmc_project/Telemetry/Triggers/{name}.
