    Catastrophic SoC error scenarios can be caused by fatal firmware errors,
    hardware faults, or watchdog timer timeouts. These conditions trigger the
    Ampere crash capture feature, which captures core and system state along
    with relevant error syndrome information.

    The crash capture feature leverages the ACPI Boot Error Record Table (BERT)
    to store the crash information in persistent storage before a reboot, making
    it available in the BERT to UEFI and the OS after the reboot
