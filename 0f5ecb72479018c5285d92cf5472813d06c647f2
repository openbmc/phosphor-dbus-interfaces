      "message": "As pointed out by Jason, the purpose of PCIeDevice.Manufacturer is to cover the Redfish property, which is the same as Asset.Manufacturer. However, the current implementation in peci-pcie is setting the Manufacturer in the PCIeDevice interface instead of the Asset interface, which has been fixed in the following commit: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/peci-pcie/+/62256. \n\nThe use of PCIe VendorID for Manufacturer is incorrect and will be fixed separately in peci-pcie. This commit is to remove the Manufacturer from the PCIeDevice interface and set it in the Asset interface instead, while a separate issue will be opened to address the use of the PCIe VendorID for Manufacturer in peci-pcie.",
