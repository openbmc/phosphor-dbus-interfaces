    Some systems have a layer of software commonly called the hypervisor. This
    software is responsible for providing a virtual operating platform to the
    operating systems running on the system. In some cases, this Hypervisor can
    have state. The implementation of this D-Bus object will allow one to
    inspect the hypervisor state and control it.

properties:
    - name: RequestedHypervisorTransition
      type: enum[self.Transition]
      default: 'None'
      description: >
          The desired hypervisor transition. The only supported transition is
          to Runtime. This property will be reset to 'None' on any system power
          off as its purpose is to allow users to move the hypervisor to
          Runtime after the default BootMode is applied on each boot.

    - name: CurrentHypervisorState
      type: enum[self.HypervisorState]
      description: >
          A read-only property describing the current state of the hypervisor
          firmware. The initial state the hypervisor goes to is controlled by
          the xyz.openbmc_project.Control.Boot.Mode BootMode property.

enumerations:
    - name: Transition
      description: >
        The desired transition for hypervisor firmware
      values:
        - name: 'None'
          description: >
            Default state, no request has been made
        - name: 'Runtime'
          description: >
            Hypervisor firmware should go to runtime state

    - name: HypervisorState
      description: >
        The current state of the hypervisor firmware
      values:
        - name: 'Safe'
          description: >
            Hypervisor firmware is in a basic safe state
        - name: 'Setup'
          description: >
            Hypervisor firmware is in an initial BIOS-setup like state
        - name: 'Runtime'
          description: >
            Hypervisor firmware is fully running and ready to start operating
            systems
