    Implement to show the states of the zone and thermal/fan PID control loop.

properties:
    - name: Leader
      type: string
      flags:
          - readonly

          In zone(/xyz/openbmc_project/settings/fanctrl/zoneX), Leader means the
          name of the thermal PID config that is driving the fans. In
          thermal/fan PID(/xyz/openbmc_project/settings/fanctrl/zoneX/PIDName),
          Leader means the hottest sensor or the highest RPM sensor name in the
          "Inputs" list.

    - name: Input
      type: double
      flags:
          - readonly

          In thermal/fan PID, this property is the "Leader" sensor value. Data
          units are based on sensor(thermal is degreeC or margin, fan is RPM).

    - name: Output
      type: double
      flags:
          - readonly

          This property is the thermal/fan PID loop result. In thermal PID, this
          data can be RPM or PWM depending on PID parameter settings. But in fan
          PID, this data is the PWM duty set for the fan.
