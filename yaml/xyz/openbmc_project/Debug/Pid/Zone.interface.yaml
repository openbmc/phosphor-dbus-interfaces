          A mapping from sensor name to a string describing the reason for that sensor's
          current fail-safe state within this zone.
          Sensors are added to this map when they are detected as failed, due to reasons such as:
            - "Sensor reading bad"
            - "Margin hot"
            - "Sensor threshold asserted"
            - "Sensor unavailable"
            - "Sensor not functional"
            - "Sensor timeout"
          Sensors are removed from the map automatically when they recover.
          An empty map indicates that all sensors are currently healthy.
