    Implement to indicate sensor which provides total power for the
    Inventory.Item associated to this sensor. The existing all_sensors/chassis
    association is used. Future direction is to use the monitoring/monitored_by
    association instead.

    Objects implementing Sensor.Purpose.TotalPower must also implement
    Sensor.Value.
