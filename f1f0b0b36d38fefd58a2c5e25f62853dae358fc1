      "message": "Who is the intended user of this \"VoltageRailType\" broken out like this?  Some of these are still fairly hardware specific (as an example the Core vs CoreAnalog seems tied to a particular design) and I worry we\u0027re going to be adding more and more of these until they effectively become strings.\n\nIs there any programmatic cases where I need to \"find me the regulator that powers the ProcessorIO rail\"?  Or are these delineations mostly for humans?\n\nI wonder if it would be useful to have instead:\n- A property for the Voltage (which we already have).\n- An enumeration for \u0027State\u0027 { Standby, Runtime } (maybe Runtime isn\u0027t a great name).\n- The name being useful for humans purposes of identifying which goes where within a single device.",
