  This interface has the component entries for all of the updateable
  components that reside on the FD.

properties:

    - name: ComponentClassification
      type: uint16
      description: >
        Vendor specific component classification information.
        Special values: 0x0000, 0xFFFF are reserved.

    - name: ComponentIdentifier
      type: uint16
      description: >
        FD vendor selected unique value to distinguish between
        component images.

    - name: ComponentClassificationIndex
      type: byte
      description: >
        Used to distinguish identical components that have the same
        classification and identifier that can use the same component
        image but the images are stored in different locations in the FD.

    - name: ActiveComponentComparisonStamp
      type: uint32
      description: >
        Optional Firmware component comparison stamp that is currently
        active. If the firmware component does not provide a component
        comparison stamp, this value should be set to 0x00000000.

    - name: ActiveComponentReleaseDate
      type: string
      description: >
        Containing the date corresponding to the component version
        level being reported – Format YYYYMMDD.
        If the firmware component does not provide a date, this value
        shall be set to ASCII null characters represented by eight 0x00
        bytes.

    - name: PendingComponentComparisonStamp
      type: uint32
      description: >
        Optional firmware component comparison stamp that is pending
        activation. This field, and all other pending component fields,
        are valid once the firmware device has received the
        ActivateFirmware command to prepare the firmware component for
        activation, but the activation method requires further action
        to enable the pending image to become the actively running code
        image.
        If no pending firmware component exists, this value shall be
        set to 0x00000000

    - name: PendingComponentReleaseDate
      type: string
      description: >
        Eight byte field containing the date corresponding to the
        component version level being reported – Format YYYYMMDD.
        If no pending firmware component exists, this value shall be
        set to ASCII null characters represented by eight 0x00 bytes.

    - name: ComponentActivationMethods
      type: uint16
      description: >
        Provides the capability of the FD for firmware activation.

    - name: ComponentAutoApply
      type: boolean
      description: >
        Firmware Device performs an ‘auto-apply’ during transfer
        phase and apply step will be completed immediately if this
        property is true.
        Firmware Device will execute an operation during the APPLY
        state that will include migrating the new component image to its
        final non-volatile storage destination if this property is
        false.

    - name: ActiveComponentVersionString
      type: string
      description: >
        Component version information up to 255 bytes. Contains a
        variable type string describing the component version.

    - name: PendingComponentVersionString
      type: string
      description: >
        Firmware component version, which is pending activation, up to
        255 bytes. The version reported here should be the one that
        will become active on the next initialization or activation of
        the component. The pending component version value may be same
        as the active component version. Contains a variable type
        string describing the pending component version.
        Refer to PendingComponentComparisonStamp field for additional
        details. If no pending firmware component exists, this field is
        zero bytes in length.
