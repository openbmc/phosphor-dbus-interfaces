Isn\u0027t that all you need for querying at an application level?\n\nThere is quite a trend in servers right now of adding CPLDs, FPGAs, and micro-controllers to do \"special\" functionality.  There are already a number of items in most servers that aren\u0027t in this list, not to mention specialized things like GPUs, NCSI-NICs, and custom accelerators, all of which could be updated by the BMC.  Between Intel (ME) and IBM (OCC) we even have items that perform very similar function but with different names.  My worry if we go down this path is that the list of enumerations is going to be quite large to the point it makes utilizing it in a useful way in a GUI pretty useless.\n\nI wonder when PSU was added and what the rationale / current use for it is.  I\u0027ll have to do some investigation.",

We may have two different PSUs that are accepted by a single server (two different manufacturers).  The \"VersionPurpose\u003dPSU\" doesn\u0027t actually tell you that the image works for the particular PSU that phosphor-psu-code-mgmt happens to support.  This is even more serious when you consider \"VersionPurpose\u003dHost\" because we have multi-host servers that can support multiple servers / architectures (think of a \"blade center\" like chassis).\n\nI personally think we made a mistake when we introduced this property even before PSU existed and we shouldn\u0027t continue in this direction.  Associations to real objects are the only fully-expressive way to express \"this software blob is applicable to this thing\".\n\nI\u0027m suspect it is possible even the \"Purpose\u003dME\" will fail in the multi-host case because we can have two different hosts managed by the same BMC with different processor generations (ie. \"Recent Lake\" and \"Older Lake\").",
