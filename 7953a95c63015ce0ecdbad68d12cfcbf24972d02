      "message": "Just like \"Discrete Sensors\" in IPMI, I don\u0027t think that a baseless-metric is a useful way to expose this information.  These sensors should be mapped to something meaningful, which in most cases we already have dbus objects representing.  If we don\u0027t do this, it is not usable by internal software (unless they do the \"typical dbus way\" and then also have special code for the \"pldm way\"), nor is it mappable to reusable management patterns in Redfish.",

      "message": "I understand. However, I do have couple of points I’d like clarification on:\n\n1. How should these sensors typically be mapped to D‑Bus properties?\nWould it make sense to use a static configuration and map them based on sensor names, or any other preferred ideas?\n2. How should we handle scenarios where the D‑Bus interface is owned by another service, and only certain properties are sourced from PLDM sensor readings? Should changes in sensor values trigger SetProperty calls to those services, or is there a recommended flow to coordinate this?\n\nMy initial thought was to let PLDM expose these as generic sensors and allow interested services to consume them based on the object path or sensor name.",

      "message": "\u003e How should these sensors typically be mapped to D‑Bus properties?\n\nYou\u0027re asking a general question for something that requires a specific answer.\n\nFor example, firmware inventory, PLDM would create `xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Verson` instances.\n\n\u003e How should we handle scenarios where the D‑Bus interface is owned by another service?\n\nThis question is fundamentally mistaken.  There is no such thing as a dbus interface being \"owned\" by a specific service.  The whole point of the architecture is that _any_ daemon can create any of the interfaces.\n\nIf PLDM has information, PLDM hosts the instances for this information.\n\n\u003e My initial thought was to let PLDM expose these as generic sensors and allow interested services to consume them based on the object path or sensor name.\n\nNo, this is fundamentally contrary to the software architecture.  We don\u0027t want _any_ daemons to know about PLDM or IPMI or any other external protocol; they should only know dbus interfaces.  We don\u0027t want every daemon to have to interface with one set of PLDM objects and then another set of IPMI objects and then another set of SPDM objects ...",
