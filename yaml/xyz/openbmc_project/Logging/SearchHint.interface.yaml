    Implement to provide search-hint attributes. This interface should be
    instantiated for the phosphor::logging namespace. This interface should be
    instantiated at the same object path as the Logging.Entry interface.

properties:
    - name: Hint
      type: string
      description: >
          The Hint parameter is used for daemons to be able to query for their
          previously recorded error, for marking as resolved. These strings need
          to be globally unique and are suggested to be of the format
          "<service_name>:<key>"
