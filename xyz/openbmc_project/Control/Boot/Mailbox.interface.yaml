    Implement to provide the boot initiator (such as Petitboot or UEFI)
    with its specific parameters. This is based on IPMI 2.0 Table 28-14
    'Boot Option Parameters' parameter 7 'Boot initiator mailbox'.

properties:
    - name: Supported
      type: boolean
      flags:
        - const
      default: false
      description: >
          Specifies whether or not the mailbox is supported by the
          boot initiator on this machine.

          The property is constant and is only set by the implementation
          on startup.

    - name: IANAEnterpriseNumber
      type: uint32
      flags:
        - const
      default: 0
      description: >
          The 24-bit IANA Private Enterprise Number for the company or organization
          that has specified the boot initiator. This is a machine-specific
          constant. The implementing application is responsible for setting
          this to the proper machine-specific value (0x000000..0xFFFFFF)
          according to https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/enterprise-numbers.

          The property is constant and is only set by the implementation
          on startup.

    - name: Data
      type: array[byte]
      description: >
          The array of data bytes for the boot initiator to treat
          in its specific way. This interface doesn't impose any
          limitiations on the format or make any assumptions regarding
          it. The boot initiator is responsible for parsing this array.

          The size of the array is a constant depending on the requirements
          set by the boot initiator used for a particular architecture or
          a machine. The implementing application is responsible for setting
          the size of this array to the proper value.

          For conformance to the IPMI 2.0 specification, the size of the array
          plus 3 (the size of IPMI 2.0 representation of IANA Enterprise Number)
          must be a multiple of 16 with the minimum allowed size being 77
          (5 x 16-byte blocks, minus 3) if mailbox is at all Supported.

          For IPMI 2.0 this array is supposed to be split into 16-byte
          blocks by the implementing service (block 0 being made of IANA PEN
          plus first 13 bytes of this array). Please pay special attention
          that this array does NOT include the IANA PEN needed for IPMI 2.0.
          Only the actual PEN-specific data is stored here.

          When partially written to, the remaining parts of this array
          must not be automatically cleared. This is per IPMI 2.0
          specification.

          Other interfaces to the boot initiator (such as MCTP) may process
          this array differently.
