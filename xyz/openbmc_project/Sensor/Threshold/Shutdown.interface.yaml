description: >
    Implement to provide shutdown class sensor thresholds.  Objects implementing
    Sensor.Threshold.Shutdown must be instantiated in the correct hierarchy within
    the sensors namespace.  The following sensor hierarchies are recognized:
      temperature
      fan_tach
      voltage
      altitude
      current
      power
      energy


    Additionally, any object implementing Sensor.Threshold.Shutdown must also
    implement Sensor.Value.

properties:
    - name: ShutdownHigh
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The upper bound of the shutdown threshold.  A value of 'NaN' is used
          to indicate there is no threshold of this type.
    - name: ShutdownLow
      type: double
      default: NaN
      description: >
          The lower bound of the shutdown threshold.  A value of 'NaN' is used
          to indicate there is no threshold of this type.
    - name: ShutdownAlarmHigh
      type: boolean
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bound.
          False if the sensor value has not exceeded the defined bound.

          ShutdownAlarmHigh may be set to False to clear an alarm condition.
          The behavior of setting ShutdownAlarmHigh to True is undefined.
    - name: ShutdownAlarmLow
      type: boolean
      description: >
          True if the sensor value has exceeded the defined bound.
          False if the sensor value has not exceeded the defined bound.

          ShutdownAlarmLow may be set to False to clear an alarm condition.
          The behavior of setting ShutdownAlarmLow to True is undefined.
