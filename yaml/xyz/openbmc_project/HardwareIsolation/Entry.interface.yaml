    Implement to provide the isolated hardware entry attributes.

    The object which implements this interface must implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Association.Definitions to point associated object, for
    example, isolated hardware inventory path and error log if it caused to
    isolate hardware. The isolated hardware association of forward and reverse
    name must be following respectively "isolated_hw" and "isolated_hw_entry".
    The error log association of forward and reverse types must be following
    respectively "isolated_hw_errorlog" and "isolated_hw_entry".

    The object which implements this interface should implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete to allow the deletion of individual
    isolated hardware object.

    The object which implements this interface must implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Time.EpochTime for the isolated hardware creation time.

properties:
    - name: Severity
      type: enum[self.Type]
      description: >
          The severity of hardware isolation.
    - name: Resolved
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: >
          The isolated hardware resolution status is used to indicate whether
          the isolated hardware is repaired or replaced. Setting this to "true"
          may not delete this entry object because in a few system platforms
          isolated hardware entries may not be deleted and used for further
          analysis.

            description: >
                The system can boot without the isolated hardware but, will lose
                the system configuration benefits of isolated hardware.

            description: >
                A user attempted to isolate hardware to proceed with the host to
                boot.
          - name: Spare
            description: >
                A Spare hardware is isolated. The system can boot without the
                isolated hardware
