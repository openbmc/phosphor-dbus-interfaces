The below greatly simplifies the content of the signal itself that needs sent, and has far fewer ways that a producer of this signal can mess it up.  IMO, it\u0027s also much more obvious, and lets consumers add matches on exactly what they want, rather than having to match on a generic threshold asserted then filter within the application.\n\nsignals:\n    - name: CriticalHighThresholdAsserted\n      description: \u003e\n          One of the alarm properties changed.\n      properties:\n         - name: SensorValue\n           type: double\n           description: \u003e\n               The sensor value that triggered the alarm change.\n    - name: CriticalHighThresholdDeAsserted\n      description: \u003e\n          One of the alarm properties changed.\n      properties:\n         - name: SensorValue\n           type: double\n           description: \u003e\n               The sensor value that triggered the alarm change.\n    - name: CriticalLowThresholdasserted\n      description: \u003e\n          One of the alarm properties changed.\n      properties:\n         - name: SensorValue\n           type: double\n           description: \u003e\n               The sensor value that triggered the alarm change.\n    - name: CriticalLowThresholdDeasserted\n      description: \u003e\n          One of the alarm properties changed.\n      properties:\n         - name: SensorValue\n           type: double\n           description: \u003e\n               The sensor value that triggered the alarm change.",
