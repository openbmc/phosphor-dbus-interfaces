I\u0027m struggling a bit with the right interface name but I\u0027ll put something up and we can discuss.\n\n\u003e We do not have any other properties or methods with \"Is\" prefixes.  I would suggest another name.\n\nSure\n\n\u003e The implication to me, based on the name and description, is that this should be a property.  Is there a reason why it is a method?  Please document the reasons.\n\nI assumed there was a reason we made the \"Execute\" one a method but I can\u0027t some up with any reason so will make a property.\n\n\u003e Will this always be a simple \"yes/no\" answer?  Should there be an enumeration or enumeration-set returned by this?\n\nWe always start simple and get burned later so yeah, I like the idea of an enum that we could expand later if needed.",
