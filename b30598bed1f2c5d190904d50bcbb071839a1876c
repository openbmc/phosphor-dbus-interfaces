      "message": "This debug host selector interface is a button type. So it has events similar to power/reset button pressed/released events. host selector interface has only host position as property and no button press/release events so that interface cannot be used for debug host selector button interface.\nwhen debug HS button is pressed and released. the released event is triggered.\nThere is a separate sdbusplus match handler which monitors this event and changes the \"Position\" property which is part of host selector interface.\n\nThe reset button\u0027s interfaces can be used as it has pressed/released signals, but the interface name will be \"xyz.openbmc_project.Chassis.Buttons.Reset\" which is not suitable interface name for debug host selector button but it should work.",
