    Interface to query trusted component info.

properties:
    - name: TrustedComponentType
      type: enum[self.ComponentAttachType]
      default: Unknown
      description: >
          The type of trusted component, such as any physical distinction
          about the trusted component.

    - name: CertificatesLocation
      type: string 
      description: >
          Providing path information for a collection of device identity
          certificates of the trusted component.

          For example, device identity certificates may be put under
          "/xyz/openbmc_project/certs/systems/{system_id}/", then
          "system_id" is what gets stored here. 

associations:
    - name: reported_by 
      description: >
          Objects that implement TrustedComponent can implement the
          "reported_by" association to provide a link to component
          integrity object that the trusted component is reported by.

          Objects that implement TrustedComponent can implement the
          "protecting" association to provide a link to the target
          component whose security this resource protects.

enumerations:

      values:
          - name: Discrete
            description: >
                A discrete trusted component. It is "discrete"
