description: >
    Defines an interface for tracking and reporting important telemetry
    statistics for a sensor or metric. This interface maintains statistics like
    peak readings and their timestamps  since the last reset. Any implementing
    object must also implement a Value interface  (Metrics or Sensors) at the
    corresponding path to provide current readings as reported by the device.

properties:
    - name: Statistic
      type: dict[enum[self.StatsType],dict[enum[self.StatsDataEnumType],double]]
      description: >
          A nested dictionary containing telemetry statistics for the device.
          The outer dictionary is keyed by StatsType (e.g., Peak), while the
          inner dictionary is keyed by StatsDataEnumType (e.g., Value,
          OccurrenceTime). Format: map{StatsType -> map{StatsDataEnumType ->
          value, OccurrenceTime-> timestamp}}
      flags:
          - readonly

enumerations:
    - name: StatsType
      description: >
          Defines the categories of telemetry limits tracked by the device.
      values:
          - name: Peak
            description: >
                The highest value observed for this sensor/metric since the last
                reset. This value represents the maximum reading recorded by the
                device.
    - name: StatsDataEnumType
      description: >
          Defines the types of data associated with each telemetry limit.
      values:
          - name: Value
            description: >
                The numerical value of the recorded limit by the device.
          - name: OccurrenceTime
            description: >
                The timestamp (in epoch seconds) when the limit value was
                recorded by the device. This may not make sense for all stats
                types and therefore can be optional
