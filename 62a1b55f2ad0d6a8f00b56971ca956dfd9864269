      "message": "I guess my thinking was an association should be specific so that a client can simply query for that association and just get the item they are looking for. If it is just \"contains\" that could be an association with anything and so puts more work onto the client to traverse everything in \"contains\" before retrieving the desired item. Is that intended?",
