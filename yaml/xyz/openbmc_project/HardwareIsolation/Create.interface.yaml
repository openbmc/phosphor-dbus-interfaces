    This interface contains create method, which can be implemented to create an
    xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry object which will use to provide
    the information of isolated hardware.

methods:
    - name: Create
      description: >
          Create an xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry object if any of
          the hardware, needs to be isolated. This interface can be used if want
          to isolate hardware without an error log, for example, the user
          voluntarily tried to isolate hardware.
      parameters:
          - name: IsolateHardware
            type: object_path
            description: >
                The hardware inventory path which is needs to isolate.
          - name: Severity
            type: enum[xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry.Type]
            description: >
                The severity of hardware isolation.
      returns:
          - name: Path
            type: object_path
            description: >
                The path of created xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry
                object.
      errors:
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InvalidArgument
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.TooManyResources
          - xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Error.IsolatedAlready
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.NotAllowed
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.Unavailable

    - name: CreateWithErrorLog
      description: >
          Create an xyz.openbmc_project.HardwareIsolation.Entry object if any of
          the hardware, needs to be isolated. This interface can be used if the
          system wants to isolate hardware with an error log that is caused to
          isolate hardware. This method is not going to create an error log and
          the consumer of this method need to pass the bmc error log which
          caused the isolation.
