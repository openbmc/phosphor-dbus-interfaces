    Implement to provide the progress on user requested activity. Objects which
    implements this interface should implement xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete
    to delete individual entries. The service hosting this interface should
    clear the entries after some time or reaching some number of entries in
    stable states like completed, failed or aborted.

properties:

          aborted, failed, new, starting, running, suspended, interrupted,
