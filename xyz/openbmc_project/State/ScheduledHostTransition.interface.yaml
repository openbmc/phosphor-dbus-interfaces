    Implement to schedule Epoch time to power on/off the Host.

    - name: ScheduledTime
      type: uint64
      default: 0
      description: >
          ScheduledTime is a date time when the host will be
          powered on/off. The time is the Epoch time, number
          of seconds since 1 Jan 1970 00::00::00 UTC.

          When ScheduledTime is 0, it means the functionality
          is disabled.
          When ScheduledTime is smaller than current time,
          error InvalidTime will be thrown.
          When the controller detects the ScheduledTime has passed,
          it will execute the RequestedTransition and reset the
          value to 0. Once the transition starts, there won't be
          any retries.
          When the real time is changed, the controller shall
          restart a new timer if the ScheduledTime is still not
          reached. Otherwise, stop the timer and check the state
          of host. If the state is not the same as required, set it
          as RequestedTransition.         
          When ScheduledTime is reached, but the host is not ready
          to power on/off, e.g. when BMC is rebooting, BMC shall
          power on/off the host after it is ready.
