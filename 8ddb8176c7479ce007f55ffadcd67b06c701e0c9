      "message": "Agree with Ratan that it seems better if the expiration policy is enforced at global level as part if account policy. Might be in that case we would need something at account level which holds when did last password reset happen for the user.",

      "message": "I have plans to use this interface property in phosphor-user-manager to configure\nuser account password expiration date. The user password expiration date contains in the file /etc/shadow and can be modified by using the \"chage\" command.\nShadow provides the opportunity for each user to have their own password expiration date. So I think it is a good idea to add the \"PasswordExpiration\" property in the \"Attributes\" and use it in the \"Users\" class from the phosphor-user-manager service.",
