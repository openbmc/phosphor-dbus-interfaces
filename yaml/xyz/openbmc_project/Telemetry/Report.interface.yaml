    Implement this interface to provide report inspection features. An
    implementation service should additionally implement
    xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete for deletion of individual report objects.

methods:
    - name: Update
      description: >
          The Update method is defined for the on demand metric report update.
          It triggers update of the Readings property. If ReportingType is not
          set to OnRequest then method does nothing.

          [sensor path, metadata] tuples, operation type, metric ID, collection
          timescope and collection duration. Sensor paths point to sensors
          providing readings. Metadata contains client information; in case of
          Redfish it shall be metric's URI. Operation type provides knowledge of
          action executed on readings. Metric ID contains name that can be
          mapped to metadata (like Redfish Metric ID). Collection timescope
          specifies type of time scope applied to specific metric. Collection
          duration stores timestamp related with timescope type in milliseconds.
