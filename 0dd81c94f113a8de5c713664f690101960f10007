      "message": "My apologies, I was specifically referring to your event log design. However, some aspects need to be refactored to align with your proposal. We previously discussed the idea of translating the event log into a Redfish message registry, as you suggested. I believe IBM plans to incorporate this in their next-generation systems.",

      "message": "Got it.\n\nI guess I left this TODO in the design document:\n\n```\n\u003e TODO: Should a tracing event be a `Logging.Entry` with severity of\n\u003e `Informational` or should they be a new type, such as `Logging.Event` and\n\u003e managed separately. The `phosphor-logging` default `meson.options` have\n\u003e `error_cap\u003d200` and `error_info_cap\u003d10`. If we increase the total number of\n\u003e events allowed to 10K, the majority of them are likely going to be information\n\u003e / tracing events.\n```\n\nDo you have thoughts around this?  I was partially leaning towards using `Informational` severity as an \"Event\".  It seems like you prefer to have them in a separate `Event` interface, but I\u0027m not sure the rationale.",
