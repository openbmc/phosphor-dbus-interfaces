If we do not document fine-grained associations, and `Inventory.Item` already documents these self associations, should we abandon this change?\n\nSince these associations are fairly quick to declare, can you push the next revision since you already know what you want to see here.\n\nThat should go quicker than me trying to grasp it, and unblock some of Christopher\u0027s bmcweb changes.\n\nThere is a comment which says this change is required:\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/83773/comments/402a9152_1f0935e4",
