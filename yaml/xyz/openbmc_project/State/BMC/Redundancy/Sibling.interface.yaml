    This interface describes the API to read information from a sibling BMC in a
    redundant configuration.

properties:
    - name: BMCPosition
      type: size
      default: 0
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The position the sibling BMC thinks it is.  Important on systems where
          there is an opportunity to plug hardware or cables in wrong.

    - name: FWVersion
      type: string
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The version of the firmware that the sibling is running.

    - name: Provisioned
      type: boolean
      default: false
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          If the sibling has been provisioned.

    - name: RedundancyEnabled
      type: boolean
      default: false
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          If the sibling BMC has redundancy enabled.  This may only make sense
          if the sibling has the active role.

    - name: FailoversPaused
      type: boolean
      default: false
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          If the sibling has failovers paused.  Redundancy is still considered
          enabled (syncs are happening). This may need to happen during certain
          events, for example during a code update. This may only make sense if
          the sibling has the active role.

    - name: BMCState
      type: enum[xyz.openbmc_project.State.BMC.BMCState]
      default: NotReady
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The BMC state of the sibling.

    - name: Role
      type: enum[xyz.openbmc_project.State.BMC.Redundancy.Role]
      default: Unknown
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The redundancy role of the sibling.

    - name: CommunicationOK
      type: boolean
      default: false
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          If the sibling BMC thinks it has good communication with this BMC.

    - name: Heartbeat
      type: boolean
      default: false
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          If the redundancy management software running on the sibling BMC is
          providing a continous heartbeat indicating that it is up and running.

    - name: FailoverImminent
      type: boolean
      default: false
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          This property is asserted when the sibling BMC is about to start a
          failover which will reset this BMC. This allows the BMC to do any
          preparation or tracing.  The grace period is implementation specific.
