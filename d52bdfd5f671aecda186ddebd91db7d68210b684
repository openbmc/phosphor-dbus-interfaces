For IBM systems we have a unique ID for cores ,its a unit64 bit number. we call that a MRU ID. But i think making it a string does not harm us and we can also have a common UniqueIdentifier interface as well.\n\nWhat do you suggest ?",

There is exactly 1 processor in the world with a particular identifier.\n\nx86 systems have a CPUID instruction, which is similar to the PVR register in Power.  Some of the language you used here made me think you were referring to this and that is why I mentioned \"cpu flags:\" because that field is derived from CPUID/PVR.\n\nYour latest comments make me think this is simply an \"absolute position number\" instead of a \"relative position number\" like the value in the object path?  ie. object path might be /.../proc1/core3 and you\u0027re looking for an absolute core id of (24 cores-per-proc + 3 \u003d 27)?\n\nCan you maybe give me an example of one of these values and how you determine it on your system?",

      "message": "Drive-by +1 to what Patrick has mentioned, this seems overly generic, and given that, I\u0027m not sure what the impact would be to things consuming this API. \n\nAt least based on your last message, it kinda sounds like you\u0027re wanting to use this to be analogous to core IDs from /proc/cpuinfo?  Maybe simply changing this to \"Index\" and adding a description that \"this should match the value given from /proc/cpuinfo core id field\" might be enough to clarify what this is for in a way that\u0027s portable to the various implementations?  That would be a lot more clear than saying its data is CPU specific.\nUnless I\u0027m mistaken (which very well could be the case) I would assume this isn\u0027t a intended to be the full output of a flags API, but just one piece of it?  The description really leaves something to be desired.",
