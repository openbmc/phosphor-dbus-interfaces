    Implement to provide user password update functionality. Since this
    needs an authenticated session, there is no need of old password.
    User ID is part of the dbus object.
methods:
    - name: Update
      description: >
          Update the user password.

          InsufficientPermission error doing so would mean that, the caller
          does not have required permission to update the password.

          InternalFailure error would mean that, caller had required
          permissions, but, there was a software error.
          Errorlog metadata would need to be looked into when this happens.
          Re-try once on this error and if that fails, do not try anymore.

        - name: NewPassword
