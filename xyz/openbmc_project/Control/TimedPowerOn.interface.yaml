          PowerOnTime is a date time when the host will be
          powered on. This function is called Timed Power On.
          The time is the Epoch time, number of seconds since
          1 Jan 1970 00::00::00 UTC.

          When the PowerOnTime is 0, it means the function
          Timed Power On is disabled.
          When the PowerOnTime is smaller than current time,
          error InvalidTime will be thrown.
      errors:
        - xyz.openbmc_project.TimedPowerOn.Error.InvalidTime
