    Implement to notify the creation of new dump. Use this interface when the
    dump is already created and ready to be offloaded. This interface will add a
    new dump object with the properties provided. The existing internal create
    interface should be used when the data is collected and the dump needs to be
    packaged.

    Any OpenBMC implementation must provide exactly one implementation of
    xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.NewDump on /xyz/openbmc_project/dump.

                The dump id provided by the source of the dump. There are dumps
                which get generated outside the BMC, like a system dump which
                gets generated and stored in the host memory. All dumps will
                have a  unique id  but when communicating to the source of the
                dump the SourceDumpId will be used.
