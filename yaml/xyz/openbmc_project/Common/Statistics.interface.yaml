description: >
    Defines an interface for tracking and reporting important telemetry
    statistics for a device's sensors or metrics. This interface maintains
    statistics like peak readings and their timestamps. Any implementing object
    must also implement a Value interface  (Metrics or Sensors) at the
    corresponding path to provide current readings as reported by the device.

properties:
    - name: Statistic
      type: dict[enum[self.StatsType],struct[double,uint64]]
      description: >
          A dictionary containing telemetry statistics for the device. The
          Dictionary is keyed by StatsType (e.g., Peak), struct defines tuple of
          value(double) and timestamp(uint64) indicating when the  value was
          recorded.
      flags:
          - readonly

enumerations:
    - name: StatsType
      description: >
          Defines the categories of telemetry limits tracked by the device.
      values:
          - name: Peak
            description: >
                The highest value observed for this sensor/metric. This value
                represents the maximum reading recorded by the device.
