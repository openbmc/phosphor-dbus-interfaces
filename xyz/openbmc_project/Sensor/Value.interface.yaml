    Implement to provide sensor readings.  Objects implementing
    Sensor.Value must be instantiated in the correct
    hierarchy within the sensors namespace.  The following sensor
    hierarchies are recognized:
      temperature
      fan_tach
      voltage
      altitude

    Any service implementing Sensor.Value on one or more objects must
    implement org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on the sensors namespace root.

    All Sensor.Value properties are read-only.

properties:
    - name: Value
      type: i
      description: >
          The sensor reading.
    - name: Unit
      type: s
      description: >
          The unit of the reading.
          For objects in the temperature namespace, Unit must be "degrees C".
          For objects in the fan_tach namespace, Unit must be "RPMs".
          For objects in the voltage namespace, Unit must be "volts".
          For objects in the altitude namespace, Unit must be "meters".
    - name: Scale
      type: i
      description: >
          The reading scaling factor N, where the actual reading is Value * 10^N.
