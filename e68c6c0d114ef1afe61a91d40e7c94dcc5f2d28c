      "message": "Is there some documentation updates needed on how these are intended to be used?  Some unanswered questions I have:\n\n1. How does the dbus path interact with this?  Why can\u0027t the dbus path of the object be used to create unique entities?\n\n2. What is the expected format of these strings?  Can any comparison be done between two objects with different versions?\n\n3. What is an \"owning entity\"?\n\n4. What is a \"message registry\"?  Nothing else in this object uses this term, so I don\u0027t even know what it is a reference to.\n\nI\u0027d like to see either a readme or a commit in docs to clarify these, in addition to any description updates that might be appropriate.",
