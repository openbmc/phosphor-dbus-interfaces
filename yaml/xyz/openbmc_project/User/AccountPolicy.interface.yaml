    - name: GetPAMOrder
      description: >
          Retrieves the currently configured PAM module order used during
          authentication.

          - name: PamOrder
            type: array[size]
            description: >
               Ordered list of PAM module indices. Each index corresponds
               to a module defined in the system's PAM configuration registry.
               The order reflects the sequence in which modules are
               invoked during authentication.

    - name: SetPAMOrder
      description: >
          Configures the PAM module order used for authentication.
          This method allows administrators to explicitly define the
          evaluation sequence of PAM modules, which affects how authentication
          decisions are made. The method validates the input order
          against system constraints and updates the configuration if valid.

          - name: PamOrder

                True if the PAM order was successfully updated,
                False if the update was rejected or failed validation.
