      "message": "Is there any relationship between this commit and https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/41050 ?\n\nI do not feel like \"ID\" is a good name for this.  To me an ID is usually an identifier.  This is an architecture-specific feature set like the \u0027flags\u0027 field in /proc/cpuinfo, right?\n\nMight \u0027Inventory.Decorator.Compatible\u0027 be used for this?  If it really is architecture specific then something like \u0027org.openpower.Inventory.Decorator.PowerArchCoreFeatureFlags\u0027 might be appropriate too?  (I\u0027m purposefully being overly verbose on the name PowerArchCoreFeatureFlags in hopes you find something better than both ID and that. ;) )\n\nIt might be good to work with someone from Intel and see if you can find an interface that works for both of you.  Also, I would suggest some research into how this is handled in the Linux kernel (see cpuinfo above) and if there is anything we can learn from how they do it.",
