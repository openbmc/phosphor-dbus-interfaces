      description: >
        Each endpoint (except the bus owner) on the PCIe bus maintains an
        internal flag called the Discovered flag. The flag is set to the
        discovered state when the Set Endpoint ID command is received.

          The Prepare for Endpoint Discovery message causes each recipient
          endpoint on the PCIe bus to set their respective Discovered flag to
          the undiscovered state. For the Prepare for Endpoint Discovery request
          message, the routing in the physical transport header should be set to
          011b (Broadcast from Root Complex).
