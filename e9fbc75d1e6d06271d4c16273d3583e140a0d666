      "message": "These names are problematic for the class generator.  When the expectation is that we will combine classes together into a single instance using sdbusplus::object, we need to have different names for members across all the combined-classes.  That is why the property names here all include their interface type, like \u003cCritical\u003eAlarmLow.\n\nWithout unique names a server will call `instance-\u003ehighAlarmAsserted(value)` and there is ambiguity as to which one you are intending to call.",
