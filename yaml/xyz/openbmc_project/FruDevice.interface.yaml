    Implement to represent a field replaceable unit (FRU)

    There are no properties listed here as the properties exposed on this
    interface unfortunately depend on eeprom contents.

    Independently from this fact, defining the interface is useful to provide
    the interface name and namespace literals.

service_names:
    - default: xyz.openbmc_project.FruDevice
paths:
    - namespace: /xyz/openbmc_project/FruDevice
