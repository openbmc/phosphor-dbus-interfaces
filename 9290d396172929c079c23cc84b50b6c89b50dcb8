      "message": "Three comments:\n\n- Isn\u0027t Common.NotAllowed typically used for the same purpose?\n\n- \"is allowed only when the host state is off\" seems very specific to a particular implementation.  I this something along the lines of \"the system or hardware is not in a state where Manual Isolation can be performed, such as hardware which can only be isolated when the system is powered off\" might be more appropriate.\n\n- Why do we have cases where new manual isolation records cannot be created but non-manual ones could?  That isn\u0027t intuitive.  Shouldn\u0027t you be able to create one at any time and the system will apply it next time it is able to?  Is there a design doc element to describe this feature/requirement aspect?",
