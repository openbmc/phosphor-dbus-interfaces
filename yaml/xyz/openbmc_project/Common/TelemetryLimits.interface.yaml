description: >
    Defines an interface for tracking and reporting important telemetry
    statistics for a device.  This interface maintains  data including peak
    readings and their timestamps  since the last reset. Any implementing object
    must also implement a Value interface  (Metrics or Sensors) at the
    corresponding path to provide current readings as reported by the device.

properties:
    - name: Limits
      type: dict[enum[self.LimitType],dict[enum[self.LimitDataEnumType],double]]
      description: >
          A nested dictionary containing telemetry statistics for the device.
          The outer dictionary is keyed by LimitType (e.g., PeakReading), while
          the inner dictionary is keyed by LimitDataEnumType (e.g., LimitValue,
          OccurrenceTime). Format: map{limitType -> map{limitDataType -> value,
          OccurrenceTime-> timestamp}}
      flags:
          - readonly

enumerations:
    - name: LimitType
      description: >
          Defines the categories of telemetry limits tracked by the device.
      values:
          - name: PeakReading
            description: >
                The highest value observed for this sensor/metric since the last
                reset. This value represents the maximum reading recorded by the
                device.
    - name: LimitDataEnumType
      description: >
          Defines the types of data associated with each telemetry limit.
      values:
          - name: Value
            description: >
                The numerical value of the recorded limit by the device.
          - name: OccurrenceTime
            description: >
                The timestamp (in epoch time) when the limit value was recorded
                by the device.
