    This defines network bonding parameters.
properties:
    - name: Mode
      type: enum[self.BondingMode]
      description: >
          Network interface bonding modes.

enumerations:
    - name: BondingMode
      description: >
          Possible bonding mode types.
      values:
        - name: RoundRobin
          description: >
              It is the default mode,in this mode system transmits packets in
              sequential order from the first available slave through the last.
        - name: ActiveBackup
          description: >
              In this mode, only one slave in the bond is active. 
              The other one will become active, only when the active slave fails.
        - name: XOR
          description: >
              Transmit based on selectable hashing algorithm.
              The default policy is a simple source+destination MAC address algorithm.

          description: >
              Transmits everything on all slave interfaces.
        - name: Dynamic
          description: >
              IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation.
        - name: TLB
          description: >
              The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load on each slave.
        - name: ALB
          description: >
              Incoming/outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load on each slave.
