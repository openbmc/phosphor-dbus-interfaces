          This is a bit mask used to specify clearing different security keys
          or resetting those values back to default by the host. Setting this
          property does not guarantee a successful operation as additional
          conditions will be checked by the host to clear/reset the sensitive
          data. This property will be mapped to a new IPMI sensor.

          The new property is having an integer value and the default value
          will be zero. The end operation is determined by the bit value set
          and some of the customer use cases which maps to bit value are

          Bit 0 - Clear All : Clear/reset all the sensitive data controlled by
                  platform firmware from the system. System can generate new
                  data to re-enable the affected functions if required
          Bit 1 - Clear OS PK : This directs OPAL to clear the OS platform key
          Bit 2 - Clear PEF SSO : This directs OPAL/PEF to clear the
                  System Security Officer certificate
          Bit 3 - Clear PowerVM System Key : This directs PowerVM to reset the
                  system key back to the default state
          Bit 4-6 - Reserved
