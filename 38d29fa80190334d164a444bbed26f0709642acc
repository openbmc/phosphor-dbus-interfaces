I was simply stating it doesn\u0027t belong under the same interface as BIOS settings manager.   \n\nThe reason it doesn\u0027t belong there is because you can not define a finite set of settings by knowing the BIOS version.  The BIOS Configuration Manager state deals with this interface.   ain the reddish forum they have talked about the settings should be in a registry or similar.\n\nThis interface is interacting with UEFI defined variables that must be obtained before they can be set by the redfish client.\n\nYou also didn\u0027t respond to my suggestion to place these under Control.Boit with the other controls for the same redfish object.",

      "message": "Thanks a lot for taking your time and reviewing my patch-set. \nSorry for marking comments as resolved. \n\nBIOS-BMC communication for managing settings is currently implemented in bios-settings-manager. Since boot option information comes from bios I placed these interfaces under bios config manager.\n\nYes, UEFI settings must be obtained from BIOS before we modify them. \nThe UEFI settings can be obtained by ipmi-oem, pldm, redfish host interface. \n\nCurrently these interfaces(from the patchset) provides the way to view CurrentBootOrder and also provides user to change the BootOrder. The user can patch under /Bios/Settings to change the Bios boot order. The backend will have to store Current and Pending Boot Order persistently. \n\nI feel adding these changes as part of bios-settings-manager would be appropriate as backend code can be implemented in bios-settings-manager. \nBut, if adding the dbus-interfaces to Control.Boot and implementing backend logic in bios-setings-manager is acceptable I can go with that approach.\n\nPlease share your thoughts.",
