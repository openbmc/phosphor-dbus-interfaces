      "message": "This is a really odd interface location for this information.  What I would suggest is:\n\n1. Create an Inventory.Decorator.I2CDevice instance to describe the EEPROM.\n2. Add an Inventory.Decorator.Compatible instance to describe the EEPROM size (based on a device-class enumeration of some sort).\n\n3. Then we can enhance EM/fru-device to probe on this device and fill in the inventory information at the same location with \"normal\" inventory interfaces.",
