    Implement to enable an object.

    A d-bus object under certain circumstances may have the need to be denoted
    as "disabled". So the object exists, but it's current state (described by
    the object properties) can't be relied upon, until the object is "enabled"
    again. What causes the object to be enabled or disabled - whether it's via
    an external interface or internal logic - depends on a specific
    implementation and use-case.

    An example could be a d-bus object that denotes boot settings. However let's
    say there's a permanent settings object versus a one-time (the next boot)
    settings object. In this case, one of these objects, typically the one which
    is not supposed to be used as a default, can implement the Enable interface
    so that a user can indicate whether this setting object is to be used or
    not, by setting the Enabled property.
