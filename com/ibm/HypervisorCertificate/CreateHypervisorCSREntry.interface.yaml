description: >
    Create Hypervisor Certificate Signing Request Entry
    This interface will be implemented on dbus service "com.ibm.HypervisorCertificate"
    and root object path "/com/ibm/HypervisorCertificate"
methods:
    - name: CreateHypervisorCSREntry
      description: >
          This method creates CSR object and returns D-Bus object path.
          This method creates object irrespective of host state.
          User needs to check for host active state before calling this method
          these objects are not persisted.
          user will delete this object once host acknowledges request.
          Object implementing this interface needs to implement the delete interface.

      parameters:
      - name: CSR
        type: string
        description: >
          Certificate signing request string.
          Host accepts CSR with maximum size of 4096 bytes.
          This implementation returns error, if CSR string greater than 4096 bytes.
          Having this check can avoid big strings even before creating object.
           
      returns:
      - name: path
        type: string
        description: >
          The object path of the D-Bus object representing CSR entry.
      errors:
        - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InternalFailure
        - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InvalidArgument
