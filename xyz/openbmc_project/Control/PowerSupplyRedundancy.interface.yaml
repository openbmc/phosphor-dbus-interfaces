      type: uint32
      description: >
        Rotation Period for cold redundancy. If rotation algorithm is BMC
        Specific, and rotation is enabled, BMC will change PSU rank order after
        this time. The unit of this PeriodOfRotation is in seconds.

            With BMC Specific algorithm, when rotation happen, BMC will add 1 to
            the rank order in each PSU and change the last rank order to the
            first rank order.

            With User Specific algorithm, user need to set the RotationRankOrder
            every time before rotation happen, then BMC will update the rank
            order to PSU.
