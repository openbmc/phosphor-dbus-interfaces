      "message": "I see there is also a proposed \"Software.Manufacturer\".  I don\u0027t really like many 1-property interfaces that daemons have to pick and choose which ones they implement, partially because it makes the clients combinatorially more complex (and you can\u0027t use the template that combines multiple interfaces together into a single C++ object).\n\nShould we either:\n1. Extend ExternalVersion to have a number of additional \u0027optional\u0027 properties?  By \u0027optional\u0027 I mean properties which could have an empty string.\n2. Add one more SoftwareAsset interface with these additional properties.",
