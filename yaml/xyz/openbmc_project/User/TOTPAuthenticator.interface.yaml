    This interface defines methods and properties required for Time-based
    One-time Password (TOTP) multi-factor authentication at user level to
    support multi-factor authentication secret key setup for each user. This
    interface implemented by each user object to support TOTP based
    authenticators like google, microsoft, etc.

methods:
    - name: CreateSecretKey
      description: >
          This method setup Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) authenticator
          secret key for the given user and returns secret key string to share
          secret key to user.
      returns:
          - name: SecretKey
            type: string
            description: >
                Secret key string which will be shared to user to setup TOTP
                applications to generate TOTP token.
