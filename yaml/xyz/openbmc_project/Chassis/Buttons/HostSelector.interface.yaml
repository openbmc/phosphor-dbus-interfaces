    Host selector interface is used to keep the position
    of the host selector HW switch as a property.
    This host selector position value decides which host
    or bmc is currently selected in a multihost bmc system
    so that the power and reset button events are
    routed to the currently selected host or bmc's power control events.

properties:
    - name: Position
      type: size
      default: 0
