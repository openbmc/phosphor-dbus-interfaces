      "message": "I am implementing the feature of populating the \"Unit\" property in the dbus-sensor package.\nActualy, dbus-sensors has the CFMSensor which calculate CFM from a tachometer. \nHowever, I think there are real air flow sensors like the SFM3020. Maybe we should define a separate namespace for FCM sensors?",

      "message": "Everywhere else we have used metric units, so I don\u0027t think we want to start using English units for airflow.  Can we use m^3/s or L/s instead?\n\nL/s actually has a similar scale as CFM.  1 L/S \u003d 2.11888 CFM.\n\nGenerally, other units have already been covered by linux-hwmon as well.  I don\u0027t see airflow covered there yet (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface).  Are we going to be contributing any drivers there?  It would probably be nice to get Guenter\u0027s feedback on appropriate units as well.",

      "message": "I got it. I was just suggest the CFM metric units as an one for airflow value, because CFMSensor was implement. if this new metric doesn\u0027t quite fit, I\u0027v like abandon of this patch and would define CFMSensor as Unit::Meters. Otherwise, if new CFM metric is required then the L/s or m^3 I like using too. I\u0027m ready do suggest new patch set.\n\nThanks!",

      "message": "Today, for better or worse, most servers use CFM;  I\u0027m not necessarily saying that going to metric here would be a bad thing, or that we should care what the industry does, but we\u0027d certainly be going against it, and in those cases we should do that openly, explicitly, and for good reasons.\n\nIt should be noted, I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s any work done in hwmon, as this tends to be virtualized sensor, but someone could certainly sync this stuff with the hwmon subsystem.\n\nQuote from the Redfish Sensors schema:\n\"This value shall indicate a measurement of a volume of gas per unit of time that flows through a particular junction.  The ReadingUnits shall be `cft_i/min\"\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/23e64207a6668319df1f273641febdeab4c09148/static/redfish/v1/schema/Sensor_v1.xml#L470\n\n\nIf someone on this thread has access to DMTF, they might go look up the discussion for the Sensor schema, and see if the units disparity was raised.\n\nInterestingly, the LiquidFlow property, literally one line down from airflow, is in liters per second.  Gotta love Redfishes consistency in these regards.",

Igor\u0027s intention was to enable all sensors in \"dbus-sensors\" to explicitly set units they use via existing interface.\nSaying that we can define both: CFM and L/s and this is the benefit of explicit units definition.",
