      "message": "The systemd-networkd default is \"Vendor\" and not \"LinkLayer\".  Are we explicitly changing this with this proposal?  Will this affect anyone with machines already in production?  I suspect we\u0027re going to want this to match the DUIDType defaulted in systemd-networkd, since, until the code is implemented to manipulate the DUIDType that is the \"default\".\n\nWhen we get the the phosphor-networkd implementation we\u0027ll want to think about how people override the default-by-default here.  I suspect some system maintainers are going to want all of their machines to use X by default where X might not be the same as the default we\u0027ve put into the dbus interface.",
