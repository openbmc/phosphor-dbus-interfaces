      "message": "Could you clarify how this is expected to be updated and what the flow will be for creating a secure session?\n\nMy understanding is as follows:\n- Any application on the BMC that requires a secure MCTP session:\n\n- The initiator (PLDM, SPDM, or a proprietary protocol over MCTP) initiates the secure session setup\n\n- The responder assigns a Session ID\n\n- The secure session becomes active\n\nAre we expecting the initiator(PLDM, SPDM, or a proprietary protocol over MCTP) to create, update, and delete the secure session via the D-Bus object hosted by the SPDM service?\n\nWhat exactly do we gain by hosting this information in the SPDM D-Bus object?\n\nDo we need to show it through OOB that how many secure sessions are active?",
