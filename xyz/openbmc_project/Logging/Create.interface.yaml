    This interface contains a Create method, which can be implemented
    to allow creation of xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry objects
    directly over D-Bus, without needing the errors defined in
    the *.Error/metadata.yaml files.

methods:
    - name: Create
      description: >
          Create a xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry object.
      parameters:
        - name: Message
          type: string
          description: >
            The Message property of the event entry.
        - name: Severity
          type: enum[xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry.Level]
          description: >
            The Severity property of the event entry.
        - name: AdditionalData
          type: dict[string, string]
          description: >
            The AdditionalData property of the event entry.
            e.g.:
              {
                "key1": "value1",
                "key2": "value2"
              }
            ends up in AdditionaData like:
              ["KEY1=value1", "KEY2=value2"]

    - name: CreateWithExtraData
      description: >
          Create an xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry object and pass in
          an array of file descriptors that point to files that contain
          additional information which may be used by the event log
          extensions.  The other arguments are the same as with Create().
          The array argument is ignored by the original logging code.
      parameters:
        - name: Message
          type: string
          description: >
            The Message property of the event entry.
        - name: Severity
          type: enum[xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.Entry.Level]
          description: >
            The Severity property of the event entry.
        - name: AdditionalData
          type: dict[string, string]
          description: >
            The AdditionalData property of the event entry.
            e.g.:
              {
                "key1": "value1",
                "key2": "value2"
              }
            ends up in AdditionaData like:
              ["KEY1=value1", "KEY2=value2"]
        - name: Files
          type: array[struct[uint32, uint32, unixfd]]
          description: >
            An array of type, version, file desciptor tuples that contain
            additional information for use by event log extensions.
              type - The format type of the data contained in the file.
              version - The version of the data format.
              unixfd - The file descriptor to the data file.
