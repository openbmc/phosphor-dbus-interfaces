          PowerOnTime is a date time when the host will be
          powered on. This function is called Timed Power On.
          The time is the Epoch time
          (since 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC) in seconds.

          When the PowerOnTime is 0, it means the function
          Timed Power On is disabled.
          When the PowerOnTime is smaller than current time,
          error InvalidArgument may be thrown.
