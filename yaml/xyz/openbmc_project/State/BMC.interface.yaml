    Implementation of BMC state management.  When rebooting we are in
    transition.  When Ready all services required are running
    successfully.  When we are Not Ready this implies not all services have
    started that are required to be.

properties:
    - name: RequestedBMCTransition
      type: enum[self.Transition]

          The desired BMC transition

    - name: CurrentBMCState
      type: enum[self.BMCState]
      description: >
          The current state of the BMC and is a read-only property.

    - name: LastRebootTime
      type: uint64
      description: >
          The last time at which the BMC came out of a reboot as determined by
          its uptime, in epoch time, in milliseconds.

    - name: LastRebootCause
      type: enum[self.RebootCause]
      default: "Unknown"
      description: >
          The last BMC reboot cause

enumerations:
    - name: Transition
      description: >
          The desired transition for the BMC firmware
      values:
          - name: "Reboot"
            description: >
                BMC system should be rebooted
          - name: "HardReboot"
            description: >
                BMC system should be non-gracefully rebooted.
          - name: "None"

                No transition is in progress

    - name: BMCState
      description: >
          The current state of the BMC firmware
      values:
          - name: "Ready"
            description: >
                Ready implies all services started and are running successfully
          - name: "NotReady"
            description: >
                Not ready implies not all services have started or are not
                running successfully
          - name: "UpdateInProgress"
            description: >
                UpdateInProgress implies BMC is in firmware update mode.
                CurrentBMCState will be set to "UpdateInProgress" while starting
                image download and reset to Ready, once activation is done or
                error case during update process.
          - name: "Quiesced"
            description: >
                BMC firmware is quiesced. The BMC firmware is enabled but either
                unresponsive or only processing a restricted set of commands.
                This state may be the result of a service within the BMC going
                into a failed state.

          The recorded reboot cause of the BMC

            description: >
                Last reboot is caused by Power-On-Reset
