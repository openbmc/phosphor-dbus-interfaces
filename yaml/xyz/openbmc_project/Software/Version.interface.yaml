description: >
    Simple definition of a Software or Firmware version. Note that this
    interface may be implemented by D-Bus objects that do not necessarily
    contain a software level. For example an OpenBMC log may implement this
    interface to store the software level of the BMC or Host for debug purposes.
    If looking for real software versions associated with a device then ensure
    this interface is under the /xyz/openbmc_project/software object path.
properties:
    - name: Version
      type: string
      description: >
          The version identifier.
    - name: Purpose
      type: enum[self.VersionPurpose]
      description: >
          The purpose of the version.  As in, what can it be used for or applied
          to?

          This property is deprecated in favor of Compatible strings and
          inventory associations.  The enumeration should not be expanded
          further.

associations:
    - name: running
      description: >
          This indicates the current running version for the associated
          inventory item.

    - name: activating
      description: >
          This indicates the current activated version for the associated
          inventory item. There can be more than one active version associated
          with the same inventory item. In such a case, RedundancyPriority
          interface will help to decide the correct priority order for the
          active version transition to running.
