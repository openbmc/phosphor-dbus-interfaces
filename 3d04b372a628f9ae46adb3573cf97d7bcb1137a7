      "message": "As proposed, associatedPath is just another results filter, like the depth and interfaces parameters.\n\nI wonder if these methods should go in a new interface.  Or if we should version the API.  Use of the mapper seems fundamental and ubiquitous enough that I would not be opposed to helping those that will never upstream their mapper client code to introspect the mapper interfaces in the conventional DBus ways.",

      "message": "Thinking about this more...\n\nAny pre-existing client code will continue to work going forward, without changes, using the old interfaces.  On the flip side, I can\u0027t think of how anyone would get themselves in the situation of new client code making use of the new interfaces, simultaneously paired with a deployment of the old mapper.\n\nThis is entering bikeshedding territory but the only other thing I can think of to consider is, is it more or less confusing to have 2 sets of methods that do the same thing (the new ones can satisfy all the use cases of the old ones) vs one set of methods but two versions?  I think for most OpenBMC developers it is probably the former.  Given that, +1 from me.",
