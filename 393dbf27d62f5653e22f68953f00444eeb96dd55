Different pieces of the software objects are created by different daemons.  I\u0027m not sure how this State object works when you likely have multiple drives in a system and those drives may have different WriteProtected states (for example).",

      "message": "Sure, I\u0027ll update Software/README.md with some context.\n\nI have noticed that the updatable state was already represented with dbus object + association\n\nWith association from\n```\n/xyz/openbmc_project/software/updatable/{SoftwareId}\n```\nto some other software to indicate that it is updatable.\n\nThis will replace that and gather the different states in one place.\n\n----\n\nI am not exactly sure what the issue is with\n\n\u003e Different pieces of the software objects are created by different daemons\n\nMy understanding is that the daemon that wants to use the States will include in as part of the daemon where it expose the software. So the daemon exposing the software will have control access to the Drive and they can independently get the WriteProtected states (Either read from the hardware or hardcoded within the daemon).\n\nWhat I was thinking about is that there is a one to one mapping between state and version (the main software interface)\n\n```\n/xyz/openbmc_project/softare/software0\n|__/xyz/openbmc_project/softare/software0/state\n```\n\n----\n\nPlease let me know if my understanding is incorrect.",
