    Implement to fetch the StateEffecterPDRs. PDRs are Platform Descriptor
    Records which are the collection of information that includes semantic
    and association information. PLDM state effecter controls or configures
    the state of an entity.
    This  API would be used by PLDM Requester apps to access the primary PDR repo.

    This implementation maintains the primary PDR repository on the BMC.
    A OpenBMC implementation provides the  implementation of
    xyz.openbmc_project.PLDM.PDR on /xyz/openbmc_project/pldm.

    More information about PDR can be found at DSP0248 version 1.2.0 section 25.

          Obtain the state effecter PDR, for the input TID,

          When the PDR for the given input TID, entity type
          and state set id is not found, then the
          xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.ResourceNotFound exception will be thrown.
