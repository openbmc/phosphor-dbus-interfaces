Who is the user of OriginatorId if it isn\u0027t Redfish and what do appropriate values look like.  \"Unique Id of the originator\" doesn\u0027t tell me enough to know, as a developer, what kind of values I should be filling in here.  And, we generally do not allow arbitrary strings to be filled into dbus objects because there is no programatic way to interpret them so we end up with random keys spread across the codebase.",
