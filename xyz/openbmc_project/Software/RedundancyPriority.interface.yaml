    The priority, for redundancy purposes, of the associated
    xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Level.
properties:
    - name: Priority
      type: uint8
      description: >
        The priority order specified for the associated Software.Level,
        represented as a value between 0 (High) and 127 (Low).  Any value
        above 127 has implementation-specific purpose.

        Only one Software.Level, per associated device, may be at any
        particular priority.  A requested priority change may cause other
        Software.Levels to change priority.

        A dual-sided redundancy model could be represented by two
        Software.Level associations, one of which is at priority 0 and the
        other at priority 1.  When a new image is Activated, the old
        priority-1 association is deleted, the old priority-0 assocation
        becomes priority-1, and the new image is assigned priority-0.
# TODO: Specify "EAGAIN" type error when priority is unable to be modified
#       due to current system state.  Currently, sdbusplus does not support
#       errors on properties.
