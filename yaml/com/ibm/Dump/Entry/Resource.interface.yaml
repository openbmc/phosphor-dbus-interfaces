    Implement this to add Resource dump management.

    The resource dumps are special types of dumps
    generated by host hypervisor. The dump is generated
    based on the resource selector. Hyperviosr needs
    a password to validate the request before creating the dump.

properties:
    - name: SourceDumpId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          The dump id provided by the source of the dump.
          There are dumps which get generated outside the BMC, like a
          resource dump which gets generated and stored in the host memory.
          All dumps will have a unique id but when communicating
          to the source of the dump the SourceDumpId will be used.
