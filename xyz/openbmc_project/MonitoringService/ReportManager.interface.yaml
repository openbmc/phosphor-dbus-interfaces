    Implement to provide reports management. Contain information about report
    limitations and allows to add report.

methods:
  - name: AddReport
    description: >
        Create new object that represent Report with
        xyz.openbmc_project.MonitoringService.Report interface stored in path
        /xyz/openbmc_project/MonitoringService/Reports/{Domain}/{Name} where
        Domain and Name are parameters of this method.
    parameters:
      - name: name
        type: string
        description: Defines the name of report to be exposed over D-Bus
      - name: domain
        type: string
        description: Defines the domain for which report will be collected
      - name: reportingType
        type: enum[xyz.openbmc_project.MonitoringService.Report.ReportingType]
        description: Defines report type 
      - name: reportActions
        type: array[enum[xyz.openbmc_project.MonitoringService.Report.ReportAction]]
        description: Defines report actions
      - name: scanPeriod
        type: uint64
        description: >
            Defines period of time when Report is updated with new values.
            ScanPeriod is in milliseconds.
      - name: metricParams
        type: array[struct[array[path],enum[xyz.openbmc_project.MonitoringService.Report.OperationType],string,string]]
        description: >
            Array of metric parameters where first parameter is an array of
            sensors DBus paths. Second parameter specifies operation type of
            metric. Third parameter is a metric Id and fourth one is a metadata
            that is used to store Redfish URIs correspondent to sensor DBus
            paths divided by commas.
    returns:
      - name: reportPath
        type: string
        description: >
            Path to new report - ie.
            /xyz/openbmc_project/MonitoringService/Reports/{Domain}/{Name}

properties:
  - name: MaxReports
    type: uint32
    description: >
        Contains the max number of metric reports supported by the
        Monitoring Service. This property is added to be compliant with the
        Redfish Telemetry Service schema, that contains MaxReports property.
    flags:
    - const
  - name: PollRateResolution
    type: uint32
    description: >
        Minimal allowed time between readings property updates. It limits
        ScanPeriod property in xyz.openbmc_project.MonitoringService.Report and
        scanPeriod parameter in AddReport method in ReportManager. ScanPeriod
        value has to be greater or equal to this value and is divisible by it.
