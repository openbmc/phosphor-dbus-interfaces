    Implement to provide fan pwm control. The method of control is hardware
    dependent and objects implementing Control.FanPwm must be instantiated
    within the sensors/fan_tach namespace.

    Any service implementing Control.FanPwm on one or more objects must
    implement xyz.openbmc_project.Sensors.Value on the object and
    org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on the sensors namespace root.

    All Control.FanPwm properties are read-write.
