I thought there was something at a Redfish level you were attempting to solve for.\n\n@Brad, should we move PcieSlot under Connector here?  Are there any implications of that elsewhere on the code-base?\n\nIt appears that it might affect some PLDM code and one case in Redfish:\nhttps://github.com/search?q\u003dorg%3Aopenbmc+pcieslot\u0026type\u003dcode",
