      "message": "I have a set of patches for 3 repositories (phosphor-dbus-interfaces, phosphor-logging, bmcweb) to implement an rsyslog filter setup through Redfish.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"design\"? If this is a document describing how \"phosphor-rsyslog-conf\" interacts with the user and \"bmcweb\" via DBus, then I don\u0027t have it.\n\nI added a new feature to \"phosphor-rsyslog-conf\" (no changes related to the number of syslog servers supported, i.e. \"phosphor-rsyslog-conf\" still only supports one syslog server).\nAnd the changes in \"bmcweb\" are made in accordance with the Redfish specification.",
