But endpoints could be management controller as well, so didn\u0027t proceed.\n\nThere was a suggestion to have the UUID in the object path to ease discovery of endpoints related to the same device. I didn\u0027t proceed with it, once reason being that UUID is optional. Other being that UUID string is \u0027-\u0027 separated and not valid in the D-Bus object path.",
