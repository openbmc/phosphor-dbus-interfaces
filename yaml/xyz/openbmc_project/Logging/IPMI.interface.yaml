    Implement to provide an IPMI System Event Log (SEL) logging interface under
    the path /xyz/openbmc_project/Logging/IPMI.

    SEL records store system event information and will contain a record ID and
    type followed by type-specific information.  The type-specific information
    includes a timestamp, generator ID (used to identify the component that is
    adding the SEL record), sensor number, event direction and event-specific
    data for system type events; or timestamp and OEM data for OEM type events.

    The interface allows adding system or OEM type events.  For system type
    events it requires a generator ID (0x20 for BMC), sensor D-Bus path, event
    direction (assertion or de-assertion), and event specific data. For OEM type
    events, it requires the record type and OEM data.

    It will assign a record ID and timestamp automatically and return the
    assigned record ID.
