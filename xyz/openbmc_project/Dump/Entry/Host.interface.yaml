    Implement to provide properties for dumps stored outside BMC.

    There are dumps which gets created and stored in host memory
    instead of BMC memory, such dumps will have an id assigned by
    the host. Implement this interface to implement the management
    of the dumps which is stored outside the BMC.

properties:
    - name: SourceDumpId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          The dump id provided by the source of the dump.
          There are dumps which get generated outside the BMC, like a
          system dump which gets generated and stored in the host memory.
          All dumps will have a  unique id  but when communicating
          to the source of the dump the SourceDumpId will be used.
