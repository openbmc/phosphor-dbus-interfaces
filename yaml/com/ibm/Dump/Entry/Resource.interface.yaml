    Implement this to add Resource dump management.

    The resource dumps are special types of dumps
    generated by host hypervisor. The dump is generated
    based on the resource selector. Hyperviosr needs
    a password to validate the request before creating the dump.

properties:
    - name: SourceDumpId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          The dump id provided by the source of the dump.
          There are dumps which get generated outside the BMC, like a
          resource dump which gets generated and stored in the host memory.
          All dumps will have a unique id but when communicating
          to the source of the dump the SourceDumpId will be used.

          When a resource dump is requested to the host, a 32bit
          number will be sent to the BMC as a token. Once the dump
          is created in the host, host will notify the BMC with this
          token, so BMC will be able to correlate which is completed.
