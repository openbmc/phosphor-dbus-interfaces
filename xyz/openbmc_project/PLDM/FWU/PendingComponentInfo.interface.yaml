    - name: PendingComponentComparisonStamp
      type: uint32
      description: >
        Optional firmware component comparison stamp that is pending
        activation. This field, and all other pending component fields,
        are valid once the firmware device has received the
        ActivateFirmware command to prepare the firmware component for
        activation, but the activation method requires further action
        to enable the pending image to become the actively running code
        image.
        If no pending firmware component exists, this value shall be
        set to 0x00000000

    - name: PendingComponentReleaseDate
      type: string
      description: >
        Eight byte field containing the date corresponding to the
        component version level being reported â€“ Format YYYYMMDD.
        If no pending firmware component exists, this string
        shall be empty.

    - name: PendingComponentVersionString
      type: string
      description: >
        Firmware component version, which is pending activation. The
        version reported here should be the one that will become active
        on the next initialization or activation of the component. The
        pending component version value may be same as the active
        component version. Contains a variable type string describing
        the pending component version. Refer to
        PendingComponentComparisonStamp field for additional details.
        If no pending firmware component exists, this field is zero
        bytes in length.
