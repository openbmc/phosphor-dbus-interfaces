            An MCTP communication terminus. An MCTP endpoint is a terminus or
            origin of MCTP packets or messages. That is, the combined
            functionality within a physical device that communicates using the
            MCTP transport protocol and handles MCTP control commands. This
            includes MCTP-capable management controllers and managed devices.

            bus owner is the party responsible for managing EID assignments for
            a given bus). A bus owner may also have additional media-specific
            responsibilities, such as assignment of physical addresses.
        - name: Bridge
          description: >

            interpreting them. The ingress and egress media at the bridge may
            be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Also referred to in this
            document as a "bridge".
