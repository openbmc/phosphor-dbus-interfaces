    Implement to provide control of a voltage regulator.  Objects implementing
    Control.VoltageRegulatorControl allow for fine grained control of a given
    voltage regulator channel, and allows external entities to control Voltage
    Regulator devices.

    Any service implementing Control.VoltageRegulatorControl on one or more
    objects must implement org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on
    /xyz/openbmc_project/vr. DBus objects must fall under this path so that
    they can be found through the GetManagedObjects DBus method.
