    Implement this interface to receive offload completed notification

    Some dumps get stored in the host memory or other systems other than
    BMC flash, but BMC stores and manages the dump entry.
    Therefore, the service implementing the dump entry management may not do
    the offload of such dumps and may not be aware of the status of such
    offloads.
    However, the services can implement this interface to know the status of
    such offloads.

methods:
    - name: OffloadCompleted
      description: >
          This method can be called the services which are implemented a
          dump offload to notify the service hosting the dump entries that
          a dump offload is completed. An enum indicating whether the dump
          offload is successful or not needs to be passed by the caller.
      parameters:
          - name: OffloadSuccessful
            type: boolean
            description: >
                Indicats whether ths offload is successful or not, pass
                true for successful offload and false for failed offloads
      errors:
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.InvalidArgument
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.NotAllowed
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Error.Unavailable
