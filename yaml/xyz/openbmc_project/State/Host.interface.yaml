      flags:
          - const
      description: >
          A const property describing the allowed host transitions. Some systems
          may not support all transitions so this property can be filled in with
          only the supported transitions. If this property is empty then all are
          supported. This list is valid from any CurrentHostState.

    - name: CurrentHostState
      type: enum[self.HostState]
      description: >
          A read-only property describing the current state of the host
          firmware. A user can determine if a system is in transition by
          comparing the CurrentHostState and the RequestedHostTransition
          properties.

    - name: RestartCause
      type: enum[self.RestartCause]
      default: "Unknown"
      description: >
          A property to define restart cause of a host.

          The current state of the host firmware
      values:

                Host firmware is transitioning to an Off state
          - name: "Standby"
            description: >
                Host firmware is in a standby state. It is awaiting a Transition
                request to On to move to Running. This is an intermediate state
                that some implementations of this object may move to between Off
                and Running.
          - name: "Running"

                Host firmware is running
          - name: "TransitioningToRunning"
            description: >
                Host firmware is transitioning to a Running state
          - name: "Quiesced"
            description: >
                Host firmware is quiesced. The host firmware is enabled but
                either unresponsive or only processing a restricted set of
                commands. This state can be a result of the host entering an
                error state or booting into a BIOS setup environment. The
                BootProgress property will provide details on which it is.
          - name: "DiagnosticMode"
            description: >
                Host firmware is capturing debug information. Powering off your
                system while the host is in this state will prevent the debug
                data from being properly collected. The host will move to one of
                the other states once complete.
