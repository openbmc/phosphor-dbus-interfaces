description: >
    Implement to provide event/error entry attributes. This interface should be
    instantiated for the phosphor::logging namespace. This interface is a
    collection of objects, therefore it is required to implement
    org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on the logging namespace root.
    Optionally, implement xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete to allow the
    deletion of individual entries.
properties:
    - name: Id
      type: uint32
      description: >
          The error event entry id number.
    - name: Timestamp
      type: uint64
      description: >
          Commit timestamp of the error event entry in milliseconds since 1970.
    - name: Severity
      type: enum[self.Level]
      description: >
          The severity of the error event entry.
    - name: Message
      type: string
      description: >
          The message description of the error event entry.
    - name: EventId
      type: string
      description: >
          An implementation-dependent unique identifier for this event. This
          property is different from Id in the sense that Id is a unique number
          per event but EventId is an optional identifier that is associated
          with the event. The content of this property is implementation
          defined.
    - name: AdditionalData
      type: array[string]
      description: >
          Additional information in the form of metadata field strings VAR=val
    - name: Resolution
      type: string
      description: >
          Suggestion for error resolution of this event.
    - name: Resolved
      type: boolean
      description: >
          Error resolution status. Indicate if the problem being reported by
          this error log has been resolved. This will start out 'false' by
          default. Setting this to 'true' will NOT result in the error log being
          deleted.
    - name: ServiceProviderNotify
      type: enum[self.Notify]
      default: NotSupported
      description: >
          If this property value is set to 'Notify', the service provider must
          be notified about the Entry. If the value is set to 'Inhibit' then
          notification is not sent to the service provider. An event of this
          type requires a service action to correct the event, such as replacing
          the hardware part or updating code.
    - name: UpdateTimestamp
      type: uint64
      description: >
          The timestamp when any property was last modified, in milliseconds
          since the epoch (1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC).  As only the Resolved
          property has a reason to change, a value that doesn't match the
          Timestamp property's value (which indicates when the log was created)
          would indicate that Resolved was changed.

                An error may occur if action is not taken.
          - name: Notice
            description: >

            type: unixfd
