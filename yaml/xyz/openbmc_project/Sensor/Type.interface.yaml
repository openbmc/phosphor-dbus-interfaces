description: >
    Implement to provide detail on type of the sensor. Each property in the
    interface maps to a distinct group of sensor subtypes.

    Objects implementing Sensor.Type shall also implement Sensor.Value.

properties:
    - name: ReadingBasis
      type: enum[self.ReadingBasisType]
      default: Unknown
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          Defines the type of the sensor based on how the sensor reading is
          determined.

    - name: Implementation
      type: enum[self.ImplementationType]
      default: Unknown
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          The type of sensor implementation indicating how the reading is
          obtained.

enumerations:
    - name: ReadingBasisType
      description: >
          Types of the sensors based on how their reading is determined.
      values:
          - name: Unknown
            description: >
                Indicates that the how sensor reading is determined is not
                known.
          - name: Zero
            description: >
                A zero-based reading. This value shall indicate a reading with
                zero as its reference point.
          - name: Delta
            description: >
                A reading that reports the difference between two measurements.
                This value shall indicate a reading that reports the difference
                between two measurements.
          - name: Headroom
            description: >
                Indicates that the reading decreases in value as it approaches
                the reference point. If the value crosses the reference point,
                the value may be reported as a negative number, or may report a
                value of zero.

    - name: ImplementationType
      description: >
          The method by which the sensor reading is obtained.
      values:
          - name: Unknown
            description: >
                The source of the sensor reading is unknown(unable to classify).
          - name: Physical
            description: >
                The sensor reading is acquired from a physical sensor.
                Service(on BMC) is monitoring the sensor reading.
          - name: Reported
            description: >
                Source of sensor reading is some other BMC/software component.
                But  sensor is represented on local BMC.
          - name: Synthesized
            description: >
                The sensor reading is obtained by applying a calculation on one
                or more properties or multiple sensors.
