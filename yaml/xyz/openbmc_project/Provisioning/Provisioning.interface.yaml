description: >
    Interface representing the provisioning state and peer connectivity status
    of the BMC. It provides properties to indicate whether the BMC has been
    provisioned and the current connection state with the peer BMC, along with a
    method to initiate peer provisioning and a signal to report its result.

properties:
    - name: Provisioned
      type: boolean
      flags:
          - readonly
      description: >
          True means the BMC is in a provisioned state.
    - name: PeerConnected
      type: enum[self.PeerConnectionStatus]
      flags:
          - readonly
      default: NotDetermined
      description: >
          Represents the connection status with the peer BMC.

methods:
    - name: ProvisionPeer
      description: >
          Starts the provisioning process on the peerBmc .
      parameters:
          - name: bmcId
            type: string
            description: >
                Identifier of the peer BMC to be provisioned.

signals:
    - name: PeerProvisioned
      description: >
          Emitted when the ProvisionPeer method completes. The signal carries a
          boolean indicating whether provisioning on the peer succeeded or
          failed.
      properties:
          - type: boolean
            description: >
                True if provisioning on the peer BMC succeeded, false if it
                failed.

enumerations:
    - name: PeerConnectionStatus
      description: >
          Enumerates the possible states of peer BMC connectivity.
      values:
          - name: NotDetermined
            description: >
                The peer connection status has not been determined yet.
          - name: InProgress
            description: >
                The system is currently attempting to determine the connection
                status with the peer BMC.
          - name: Connected
            description: >
                The peer BMC is detected and reachable.
          - name: NotConnected
            description: >
                Peer BMC connection failed.
