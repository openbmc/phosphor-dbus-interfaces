    Implement to provide event logging.

    This interface should be instantiated for the phosphor::logging namespace.
    This interface is a collection of objects, therefore it is required to
    implement org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on the logging namespace root.
    Optionally, implement org.openbmc.Object.Delete to allow the deletion of
    individual entries.
