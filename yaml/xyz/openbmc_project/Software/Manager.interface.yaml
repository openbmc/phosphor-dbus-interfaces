    Implement this interface for clients to identify the code update manager
    which will process the multi part image and orchestrate with code updaters
    for the code update process. This is an optional interface to be implemented
    if the client needs to delegate the code update process to the code update
    manager for multi part images. The implementer also needs to implement the
    xyz.openbmc_project.Software.Update interface for the client to pass the
    multi part image and update parameters.
