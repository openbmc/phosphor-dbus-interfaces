    Implement to emit D-Bus signal for PLDM Event Messages. PLDM Event Messages
    are PLDM monitoring and control messages that are used by a PLDM terminus to
    synchronously or asynchronously report PLDM events to a central party called
    the PLDM Event Receiver.

    When the PLDM daemon receives a sensorEvent of type stateSensorState, it
    emits the StateSensorEvent signal.

    This signal would be used by PLDM Requester apps on the BMC, which will rely
    on this signal to determine state changes on a connected PLDM entity.

    More information about PLDM Event Messages can be found at DSP0248 version
    1.2.0 section 13.
