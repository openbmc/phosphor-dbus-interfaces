      "message": "From the Redfish Forum’s reply, it seems like there are 2 reasons to make `Step` as a string.\n1. Json by default is not supporting hex value encoding. Even for the CPU architectures like x86 ensures the `Step` to be a numeral. We still need the value to be `string`. Otherwise it will be converted to decimal.\n2. For non-x86 CPU architectures, it’s not guaranteed that the `Step` from CPU register must be an numeral. So `Step` needs to be `string` to have flexibility to support those cases.",
