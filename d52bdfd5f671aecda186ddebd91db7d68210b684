For IBM systems we have a unique ID for cores ,its a unit64 bit number. we call that a MRU ID. But i think making it a string does not harm us and we can also have a common UniqueIdentifier interface as well.\n\nWhat do you suggest ?",

There is exactly 1 processor in the world with a particular identifier.\n\nx86 systems have a CPUID instruction, which is similar to the PVR register in Power.  Some of the language you used here made me think you were referring to this and that is why I mentioned \"cpu flags:\" because that field is derived from CPUID/PVR.\n\nYour latest comments make me think this is simply an \"absolute position number\" instead of a \"relative position number\" like the value in the object path?  ie. object path might be /.../proc1/core3 and you\u0027re looking for an absolute core id of (24 cores-per-proc + 3 \u003d 27)?\n\nCan you maybe give me an example of one of these values and how you determine it on your system?",
