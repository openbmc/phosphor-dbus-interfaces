I don\u0027t think anyone would ever set RetryAttempts if the AttemptsLeft has been or is being decremented(don\u0027t think that applies to any use cases).\nIt\u0027s a minor maybe redundant change, but if someone sets the RetryAttempts policy to 5 and AttemptsLeft is only at three the discrepancy may alarm them.",
