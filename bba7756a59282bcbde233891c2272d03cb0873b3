      "message": "Following on a little from previous discussion about networks:\n\nI think the layout at the moment, with separate networks \u0026 endpoints, makes the most sense. I\u0027m not so sure networks being optional though. If we\u0027re representing MCTP endpoints (ie, something that has an EID), then the endpoint has to be on one (and only one) network. That network may well be the \u0027default\u0027, for cases where the system only has one network - which will probably be the usual case.\n\nSo I think the fixed structure of /xyz/openbmc_project/mctp/\u003cnetwork\u003e/\u003cendpoint\u003e would work best.",
